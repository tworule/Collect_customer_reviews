There are too many good things to do in Wicker Park to waste your time in a 2 hr queue. :flag: Never a bad taco. Delish Micheladas. Great people watching. And cheap whiskey shots. :flag: The drinks were just ok and the food was mediocre at best. This place gets high rating and I just can't figure out why. :flag: It's difficult to beat a classic.

Cannot wait to go back :flag: I went for the first time this past weekend and I tried fish tacos, and beef taco, taco al pastor. All of them very good.

A bit overrated but still a place I frequent. Cash only. :flag: Mmmm, tacos. :flag: So often a crowded mess, but it's still a great spot on a lazy afternoon. :flag: Great vibe and good prices. Fun with a group- hipster party feeling. Food is good but nothing special. :flag: Tilapia tacos :flag: Tacos are the star at this whiskey bar :flag: Yummy margaritas :flag: Tacos de pescado + fish tacos are sooooo good , definitely a must to try. Guacamole is amazing as well. If you are a taco lover definitely check this place out. :flag: One of the better Taco places judging on the wait and line to get a table. :flag: Try the Walking Taco :flag: Great funky tacos! Long waits, cash only. :flag: Tacos, guac, horchata. Get take out when crowded. :flag: Los tacos de panza en realidad son de barriga (carnitas) y son extraordinarios.

Fish tacos are SO good! :flag: The staff is just rude. I spent a total of four minutes there because I couldn't believe three staff members had been so rude upon walking in.

Must order guac. :flag: Divine tacos. :flag: Overhyped place but the tacos are decent here and there . :flag: They have vegetarian options. Fair price :flag: Overpriced.

Two tacos makes for a hearty meal. :flag: Imagine the world has been taken by zombies and the society as we know it is about to collapse. Make sure you stop here first and get Queso Fundido and porkbelly tacos. :flag: Take out tacos were pretty cheap but good. :flag: Taco's!!!!! :flag: Stay away from the obscenely priced whisky. Go to Binny's and get yourself a whole bottle instead. :flag: Fish Tacos :flag: Love the tacos :flag: They are always super crowded.

Would definitely go there again :flag: The Walking Taco - it comes in a Frito's bag :flag: Amazing tacos and beer. Nuff said. :flag: Good tex mex in wicker park. Reminds me of being back in Houston. :flag: Tacos are really good. This place can get busy, make sure to plan for a wait. Grab a pitcher of margaritas while you wait. :flag: Tacos, outdoor seating :flag: Pastor and/or Panza + Pescado. :flag: $1 Rhinelander Shorties! :flag: Everything.  But especially the Michelada and pork tacos. :flag: Fish Tacos are the best! :flag: Fish tacos, whiskey, sunshine. :flag: Great late night spot and amazing tacos! :flag: Fish tacos :flag: Half taco hut, half whiskey joint, Big Star is the place for al fresco meet-ups in Chicago. When the weather is warm, the doors of this former garage are raised and open tables disappear in a flash. :flag: Awesome tacos.  Always crowded.  Good beer :flag: Everyone knows Big Star is famous for its cheap and tasty tacos but it's the queso fundido that really wowed my tastebuds. Melted queso Chihuahua cheese compliments the peppers and meaty chorizo. :flag: The service is utterly rude, hostesses give no information on what to do while waiting for a table, and it seems there's no approach to customer assistance. Taco de papas & tostada de hongos are good. :flag: Don‚Äôt have hours to spare lined up on Damen? Head to the bar to order or avoid the hipster hordes altogether and opt for the to-go window. :flag: Try the fish tacos :flag: If you don't want to wait, shoot for a noon arrival during the week. The taco with chariso (sp) is a hit. :flag: Rajas, Panza, Pollo & Michelada to drink. I love this place but I hate that they will not give you a large container for chips & salsa to-go. Six small containers is really annoying. Is it that hard? :flag: They never run air conditioning so this isn't the place to hit when it's hot unless you love that sauna dining sensation :flag: Get a pitcher of margs and the fish taco :flag: The bar that took over the Pontiac space is just that: A bar. With whiskey shots, cheap beer, and quick cocktails. :flag: Michelada is ON POINT #YUM :flag: Pastor Taco - yum yum! Queso fundido and Guac for appetizers! :flag: Taco window is great, but main place staff are rude to Asians and foreigners. :flag: Pastor tacos and the guac were so good :flag: $40 for a pitcher of margaritas and I stumbled away very happy! Queso fundido, Baja taco and guacamole are outstanding. Go drink at the bar, the hostess will text you when your table is ready. :flag: The Chorizo taco is great!!! :flag: Everything is good and fresh :flag: Fish Tacos! :flag: I love this joint. They have a large menu selection that has semi-healthy options and plenty of fried items if you're having that kind of day! :flag: Great breakfast burrito! :flag: Best breakfast burrito I've had. :flag: Mexican beef taco and vegetarian taco were pretty tasty. The Hawaiian taco was ok. The mic Diddy and fries were really good! :flag: The taco selection is to die for :flag: excellent service here! don't skip the poke :flag: The kimchi fries are overwhelming. You have to really like kimchi... The Honkey burrito was forgettable and very unhealthy. :flag: Ahi tuna poke taco. :flag: Decent friend shrimp, good tacos. Cheap hot dogs! :flag: A lot of variety in the menu :flag: Their kimchi fries have superpowers. :flag: RIP Als Beef and Potbelly :flag: This location has a couple exclusive menu items and also does breakfast. Great addition to the area. :flag: Be prepared to sit communally at this lively diner. The logo is too cute and the food is too big but come hungry and leave fueled for a day of site seeing. We üíï‚Äôs Bi Bim Bop & Sourdough Pancakes :flag: Very interesting dishes and desserts, gets really crowded though, reservations recommended especially on a weekend night. :flag: Get the okonomiyaki!! So tasty! My goat chop jae was delicious too! Will come back again üòä do make a reservation though cuz it gets crowded. :flag: Delicious paratha burrito. Friendly vibe with a fusion twist on breakfast! :flag: The patty melt is to die for. But whatever you get, prepare to be uncomfortably full for the rest of the day. :flag: Such good food. Great atmosphere. Amazing waiters. Note: everything is a la carte meaning sides not included, but everything was very reasonably priced. Great flavors in everything we tried. :flag: The Little Piggy Went to China is easily the best dish I‚Äôve had here. Well-balanced and spicy enough without being overwhelming. :flag: Fun atmosphere and eclectic menu - something for everyone. :flag: Ordered the Little Piggy Went To China, a daily omelette, crab dip, and the okanomiyaki. Everything was really heavy and with huge servings. Scone and sausage for the Little Piggy were highlights. :flag: Little Goat Latte, Cheesy Hashbrowns, Bullseye French Toast, Shrimp & Grits, Crab Dip, all incredible. Came here on a Monday and there was no wait. 100% recommend! :flag: The French Toast was recommended,  it was fantastic!!  Lived up to the hype# :flag: Definitely get the Fat Elvis Waffles  if you‚Äôre craving something sweet. If you don‚Äôt have much of a sweet tooth, you might be able to pass on this one. :flag: The biscuits and gravy were maybe the best I‚Äôve ever had. The mushroom sausage gravy was unique but still satisfied my craving for this classic dish. The biscuits alone were absolutely perfect. üëåüèΩ :flag: Can‚Äôt go wrong with anything on the menu :flag: Great brunch option. Corned beef hash and spiced apple pancakes (for the table) were awesome. :flag: Delicious grilled cheese sandwiches and amazing breakfast dishes. :flag: Definitely a treat your self meal. Everything is very rich but perfectly executed. My favorite is the pork belly pancake. :flag: Perfect spot for breakfast. The Bim Bim Bop bowl and their crumpets with lox, fried egg salad and cream cheese was an excellent mix of different flavors. Also suggest a side of breakfast sausage! :flag: They have breakfast all day. Los drowned sandwich is yummy and melts in the mouth. :flag: Elevated yet homey bfast. Supplement your meal with a pastry (sticky bun if avail). The everything crumpets are a delish take on everything lox and bagel. Fried egg salad is new, interesting twist üç≥ :flag: pork tonkatsu sandwich, smoked fries, and any of the seasonal salads. :flag: Fat Elvis waffles is a must try! Great spot to satisfy all brunch needs. :flag: Good food! An entire gluten free menu. Get pancakes or something off the lunch or dinner menu. The drinks and bakery are great too! :flag: I had the French toast it was delicious with a whisky cocktail :flag: Everything here tastes good. :flag: Try everything: omelet of the day is usually really solid :flag: The patty melt is perfection of cheesy gooey and the caramelized onions with a great burger :flag: Too much hype for an average experience. :flag: Solid breakfast, close to your office. :flag: The specials are always fantastic, and the a la carte breakfast menu means there's something for everyone! :flag: Everything. The crab crumpets, fat Elvis waffles, tempura mashed potatoes, and cheeze it sundae were all worth the trip. :flag: Main menu has some vegetarian options (really good veggie quesadillas), but ask for their vegan menu and you'll be right as rain. :flag: Everything!!! Rebecca is the BESTüôåüèæ :flag: Amazing food. Lots of gluten free options.  Don't let your eyes be too hungry because the portions are huge. Make sure to at least get a half order of fries to share because they are magic ‚ú®üçü‚ú® :flag: Solid modern diner food. Chicken pot pie good for cold days. üçΩ :flag: This place is fantastic. Great drinks and really care about you being celiac! Highly recommend. :flag: The Elvis waffles are out of this world delicious. Sweet, savory, salty..yum. :flag: I had the bulls eye bfast plate and it was delicious, the price was reasonable and the service was nice ! :flag: Fat Elvis waffles and cheesy hash browns are perfection. Viva Stephanie Izard! :flag: Interesting brunch options. Liked the Chinese benedict :flag: üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº go for it if you can't get into girl and the goat and want to try chef Steph's creations! :flag: Voted Best Coffee by Bitches Who Brunch in 2016! :flag: Voted Best Meats Brunch by Bitches Who Brunch in 2016! :flag: In general the breakfasts here are pretty heavy and you can't order your basic eggs and bacon, but I had The bulls eye French toast. It was incredible! :flag: Ooh, we love when you guys melt cheese all over the bread and make the whole grilled cheese crispy. :flag: French garlic cheese bread to share and then any of their hamburgers... they are huge. Good value for money. :flag: With bold dishes, exotic and unique flavors, this spot has a little bit of something for everyone. :flag: side of crumpets for a breakfast app!! üôåüèº :flag: Awesome bull's eye French toast (egg in a whole served with cutlet chicken) - great atmosphere, service and menu options! :flag: We tried mashed potato tempura! Great! :flag: Spanish omelette and the French toast!!!! Delicious!! :flag: It's diner food that you have to wait a long time for :flag: Little disappointed this time, but I remember it being fantastic.  Didnt dig the fish tostadas :flag: Little Goat cold-smokes its hand-cut fries before frying them proper. The result is less jarring than it sounds; they‚Äôre really just a heap of a well-executed side. :flag: Good food!!! :flag: Pork belly pancake is a must try. :flag: This little piggy goes to China was pretty damn amazing! Coffee is locally brewed from Dark Matter. Sit at the counter to avoid the wait! :flag: Everything on the menu is a la carte so can be pricey when ordering even a couple items. It is delicious and worth the money. :flag: Fat Elvis waffles!!! Yum yum!! :flag: Fat Elvis Waffle. Mic drop. :flag: This diner serves creative interpretations of comfort foods. We‚Äôre talking kimchi, bacon-and-eggs scallion pancakes and Fat Elvis waffles topped with peanut butter, banana and bacon maple syrup. :flag: SwagMeter: 4.5/10. Cute shirts but unimaginative hats. Lots of home items that will just end up collecting dust at home. :flag: Food was amazing! :flag: Was real pleased with the cinnamon bun. Pork belly scallion pancake was great. Would definitely return here to try more stuff. :flag: I always end up getting their brunch menu (than lunch). Fat Elvis waffles and Bulls eye French toast are must try, for sure. :flag: The Piggy Goes to China was incredible :flag: It was my 1st time & had the French toast w egg, chicken n strawberries and it was delicious!!!! It's definitely a bit of a heavier dish so you share w someone else. So yummy!Bloodymary was tasty too! :flag: I could eat just the hash browns here -- shredded finely with cheese and griddle-fried to crispy perfection. Ask for their homemade hot sauces. :flag: It's all good here, but the French Toast is my go to. :flag: It was so hard picking the right thing to eat. Sat at the counter and watch so much deliciousness leave the kitchen. Go here. :flag: Get the hashbrowns! :flag: The goat chili cheese fries were amazing! Great flavor and nice to share! :flag: Bull's eye french toast has an egg in the middle and fried chicken + bbq maple syrup ftw :flag: Best Restaurants according to radicalpossibility.com :flag: Goat Almighty burger is...aptly named! :flag: Take an uber because street parking is difficult and the valet parking is $14. :flag: bakery is on point. got the veg omelette which was huge -- i had the leftovers later for dinner. :flag: IF YOU DONT LIKE TO SHARE TABLES, MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR "PRIVATE SEATING" IT DOES ADD TO YOUR WAIT TIME UNFORTUNATELY - A LITTLE PRICEY TOO :flag: Service is great! Place is very comfy and clean. Food beats New York! Must get the bulls eye French toast!! :flag: Breakfast! :flag: French toast w fried chicken :flag: The patty melt and chili were fantastic. :flag: Split the pork belly scallion pancake and the goat burger (medium rare) patty melt style with my friend, and both were very delicious. Pork belly scallion pancake trumped for me, but not by much! :flag: I had been here a few times and been impressed but this time I got the Los Drowned. Game. Changer. The flavors of the slow roasted beef with the pickled slaw, black beans, avocado... you're welcome. :flag: The apple tomato soup and grilled cheese combo. Not a combo but make it one and thank me later. :flag: The scallop special and carrot soup are incredible. They use ginger in a lot of their dishes which gives them a unique flavor :flag: Love this place for breakfast, lunch and all those in between meals. Los Drowned, the brussel sprouts, and cubano sandwich were all amazingly flavorful. All meats were tender and juicy. Bring friends! :flag: What's better than chicken & waffles? French toast and waffles of course! Try the bullseye. It's awesome! :flag: The food was super good! But be prepared to wait a bit for a table!! :flag: The crumpets. :flag: The Smoked shake And The sandwiches :flag: Excellent cocktails, ambiance and food. The little sister of Girl and the Goat. :flag: Hash browns :flag: Just amazing.  Atmosphere is so pleasant you won't want to leave and the grilled cheese sandwich and broccoli I ordered was the best I've ever had. :flag: This Little Piggy Went to China was life changing. :flag: Shrimp and porkbelly :flag: Stump town coffee to drink, all of the items are incredibly unique. We had the "Little Piggy went to China" and the Porkbelly Pancake. The sides are served family style, which is such a nice touch. :flag: The pork belly pancake and he little piggy went to China were great brunch treats!! :flag: Excellent brunch :flag: Goat chili cheese fries. Giant biscuits. Cinnamon rolls. Everything here is good, even the beer list :flag: Fish tostadas üëåüèæ :flag: Hey Little Goat, you should join Freebie! It‚Äôs pretty rad and the benefits are great for both you and me. Check it out! http://taps.io/freebie :flag: Excellent ! :flag: The best brunch atmosphere and food we've had in a long time. Portions are sizable so split everything so you can try it all. Something for everyone! :flag: Top 3 spots in Chicago! :flag: Little Pig went to China is a must. :flag: The food is always amazing, the service is spot on. :flag: It's a gourmet diner concept. Good but didn't blow my socks off :flag: The patty melt is delicious and has the thickest caramelized onions I've ever seen. :flag: The caramelized onions on the patty melt are thickfreakness. The Sloppy Goat is everything you're hoping for. The Eames chairs will keep you comfortable while inhaling all the food. :flag: "Little Pig went to China" :flag: So delicious, whether you want upscale comfort food or crazy awesome Asian blends :flag: Great breads so order a sandwich...the BLAT was delicious as was the chicken sandwich, largely due to the griddled bread. :flag: Must try the Elvis bacon waffles! Absolutely mouth watering :flag: Chick Pea Salad...one of the best salads I've ever had! A party of flavors in your mouth! üòã :flag: Reuben with kimchi on rye was delicious! :flag: 9: If they have any cinnamon rolls left, you get them. Busy atmosphere where you get to cozy up next to strangers adding to the fun experience! Crazy sounding menu, but it is all delicious! :flag: Amazing breakfast spot! I'm vegetarian, and there are plenty of options - but I had a veggie version of the Bulls Eye French Toast...TRY IT!! :flag: So, the fat Elvis is actually soaked in maple-bacon syrup. Too soggy too sweet. Killed it unfort. :flag: Grilled Cheese Sandwich!!! :flag: What a great nachos machos. :flag: Everything is good....make reservations :flag: Fun for a modern Americana breakfast and decent coffee too. :flag: Fat Elvis Waffles are A+++. Will make you into a fat Elvis. :flag: I had high expectations and was slightly disappointed. Obviously this place is better than most other diners but what we had wasn't all that special. We had a particularly awful server. :flag: What isn't delicious here?!? :flag: Wonderful brunch at a diner opened by the chef behind Girl & the Goat. Both inventive menu items and classics in an unimpeachably cute Wes Anderson-like setting. I loved the Went to China biscuit. :flag: The Little Goat latte is one of my all time favorite coffee drinks. Goats milk, caramel and masala spices - sweet and smooth and not even a little "goaty". :flag: The dishes I had were okay. Not great. The chicken on the french toast was good but the french toast itself wasn't. Don't waste your time on the cheese grits. The hash brown dish was okay. :flag: Great place for vegan alternatives. From basic sunny side up egg and toast combo to their loco moco bunless burger, they do right by your tastebuds. If you're feelin' frisky try the "The Little Goat". :flag: The cocktails! I loved the eastmans ride. The bar is adorable. Great place for a drink! :flag: Their nachos and fries are yummy :flag: It was good food. I wouldn't come back again though. :flag: Order this ... You will feel good, full and never sorry :-) :flag: Eat the Los Drowned :flag: The hamburguer :flag: There is perfection, I really loved everything in the menu. Portions are big enough for two people :flag: A must visit in Chicago. Sit at the bar :flag: Everything is great! I would rate it at infinity if I could but since ratings are usually 1-10, I'll give it an 11! :flag: The sloppy goat was amazing, definitely recommend that! :flag: My big crush during my first trip to chi town. Will try their big sister restaurant next time! :flag: Blueberry pancakes will fill all the cracks in your heart :flag: A breakfast diner along with comfort foods makes me wonder what took me so long to pop in. I plan to be a regular when in Chicago. :flag: Go-to place for high end breakfast in the West Loop. If the full service area looks pricy the coffee bar area is great for Stumptown coffee and baked goods plus the substantial and tasty egg Naanwich. :flag: Tempura Mash potatoes are exceptional :flag: The nachos are amazing but huge...I could hardly eat anything else after sharing four ways. Reuben is a great choice for main dish. Skip the tempura potatoes, a bit bland :flag: THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT TO CHINAsesame cheddar biscuit . sunny eggs . szechuan pork sausage . chili garlic chive sauce . blackberries Amazing :flag: The pork belly pancake is excellent! Cinnamon roll is great. All of the ice cream desserts! All of them! Also got Taco Bread from the bakery. It's delicious. :flag: Great burgers and breakfast :flag: I feel like the quality has gone down since the past few times I've been here. I was kind of disappointed at brunch. :flag: Great spot for brunch or a casual dinner. Bulls Eye French Toast is excellent. Goat sloppy Joe is great too. Try the desserts! :flag: I üíó the Little Goat latte :flag: Try something out of your comfort zone. I guarantee you it'll be delicious. :flag: Yummy!!! Goat burger! Medium rare! :flag: All American burger and fries :flag: The food is good, but service can be pretty lackluster. Be prepared to wait both for a table and for your food. :flag: Both times my brunch plate has been completely drowned in syrup, overpowering all other flavors. I don't get the hype, especially for the $. :flag: Excellent service, atmosphere, menu. Would recommend making a reservation in advance :flag: The Fat Elvis was arguably the best breakfast I've ever eaten (waffles, peanut butter butter, bananas and bacon maple syrup) :flag: Super hip and cool. Classic diner food with inspiration from street food around the world. :flag: Frankly, hard to go wrong. The specials are usually delicious, especially when they don't sound delicious. :flag: If you can't get a reservation at girl and the goat try this place. For breakfast or lunch, simply delicious! Long wait but worth it. :flag: All sorts of yummy food, especially liked the ravioli and the veggie pastrami :flag: So far, the Brussels sprouts are my favorite. :flag: This brunch is actually worth the hour wait. Famous chef creativity at moderate prices. French toast with fried chicken and an egg in the hole, and the pork belly pancakes. :flag: Kimchi & bacon & pancakes & hash browns..... Welcome to Chicago :flag: Very relaxed atmosphere and great comfort food. Try the chilli cheese fries and machos nachos in starters :flag: Shrimp and grits are phenomenal. Not too many places one can get great grits in Chicago. :flag: The Goat Almighty burger and fried pickles and onion rings. :flag: This is the sort of place that lets you sample everything you really want to eat on those buoyant days when you ditch the carb count: shepherd's pie, pork belly pancakes, oyster po'boys, etc. :flag: Parathas burrito - 2 thumbs up! üëçüëç :flag: Must have: Los drowned, hot crab dip and smoked fries. Also, if you like a Big Mac from McDonald's, get the All American burger. :flag: Just a pretty Denny's. Save your money and go there for dinner food. :flag: Tasty diner fare with a large menu. Only caution: things can get goat heavy if you aren't careful with ordering. Great service. Family friendly. :flag: Bullseye French toast! :flag: Everything is divine. Even if you can't make up your mind, just order some eggs sunny side up, toast, jam and you'll still be satisfied. :flag: The Blue Plate special's are the star here. The Breakfast Dog is pictured. :flag: Crab dip - da bomb. Brussles -da bomb. Club Sammy - da bomb. :flag: The fall harvest salad is very fresh with so many interesting flavors combined. The mushroom burger with the cheese sauce and goat meat was absolutely AMAZING! :flag: Get the Machos Nachos, YUM!! :flag: Wonderful fine dining level food in a diner atmosphere. Sit at the counter and you can watch the tasty food come out of the kitchen. :flag: I came here for a corporate event and the private room upstairs was just gorgeous. Definitely recommended for corporate events or just a casual brunch! :flag: Get the Machos Nachos for appetizer to split, and Mac n Cheese as a side. Delish! The Los Drowned is a good sammich. For dessert, get the Cookie Pie - so good!!! :flag: Didn't get a chance to try the full menu but the coffee & bagel with kimchi cream cheese was excellent. :flag: The patty melt was Delicious! :flag: Put your name down for brunch. The wait won't be as long as they say. Go grab a drink at Lone Wolf in the mean time. :flag: If kimchi is your thing, get either the korean burger or the kimchi/pancake/eggs dish. Great cocktails too! :flag: Maybe all the hype I've heard about this place was what left me so disappointed. Food took a long time; I had the Bulls Eye FT and it was just not to my liking and my chai was basically undrinkable. :flag: Get the Pork Belly Pancake it's insanely delicious. Also try the Fried Pickles & Onion Rings for an appetizer :flag: Everything! :flag: üòãüëçüòãüëçüòã :flag: The Bulls eye french toast was good - not great for $16. The chicken on top was hard, chewy and crusty, I pushed most of it aside. Lovely, light atmosphere. A modern take on a diner. :flag: Sajid is right, sloppy goat tastes like keema pav! Its delicious. Also, get the french toast for the table. :flag: Best Patty Melt I've ever had. The desserts are phenomenal, try the mini pies!! :flag: Food is great ambiance is fun and low key but what really shines is the service!! Best bday dinner I've ever had! :flag: Bullseye French toast. To die for! :flag: The crab dip is cheesy and creamy and delicious! :flag: The parathas buritto or pancakes gets me every time! :flag: The French toast is incredible. :flag: I think my chili cheese fries were delivered from the meat gods. De. Li. Cious. Followed by a Los Drowned sandwich and the Classic vanilla gelato sundae, I went home very full and very happy. :flag: Had the pad Thai and the yellow curry chicken. Both were great! :flag: Delicious. A bit expensive but really good. :flag: Veggie potstickers are sooo good! I love how well they cater to food allergies, so so accommodating. :flag: Chicken potstickers and hot and sour soup. :flag: Pomegranate ginger ale, hot and sour soup and chicken potstickers was delicious. :flag: Good pan Asian.  Not great, but solid. :flag: nice Thai restaurant! :flag: Asian food! :flag: Solid food but nothing special. The stir fries are the way to go; portion sizes are hefty. :flag: Pomegranate ginger ale, shrimp summer rolls, panang curry :) very fresh, great service. :flag: Spicy food. Good place :flag: Order spicy sesame peanut noodles as appetizer. You'll thank me ! :flag: Huge portions as usual in Chicago but really tasty. Feels like truly Asian :flag: Pues mas o menos. guisados con pocos sabor y otros saturados con dulces . arroz frito mal condimentado. dips de pasts y rellenos sin sabores. lugar relativamente agradable y buen servicio.no regresare :flag: Excellent service fwa :flag: Watch out for pick pockets! My wallet was stolen at this location. :flag: Basically just overpriced food court Chinese. Save yourself the time and money and head to Panda Express. :flag: Love it! Nice appetizers so I rarely order an entree. You must have the gingerale - real ginger spice! :flag: Chicken satay :flag: Sesame chicken is awesome :flag: When they say spicy they actually mean spicy. Also the orange chicken is bomb :flag: Epic potstickers, stir fry bar, pad thai! :flag: Come early for lunch, it gets crowded fast. :flag: Exactly the lunch I was looking for. Also they have their own beer. :flag: Kung Pao Chicken :flag: Panang curry chicken n pomegranate ginger ale must!! :flag: Order the house-made ginger ale. :flag: 1st time going there and it was so good, great staff, good food, free wifi, and fast. After ordering, when's to the bathroom to was my hands and the food was already out on the table!!üëåüëç :flag: I prefer to pick something spicy off the menu rather than create my own. :flag: The whole menu - it's quick, tastes great. Always enjoy eating here. :flag: Golden shrimp toast: One of those unexpected unions of two foods. A more proper description might be shrimp French toast: minced shrimp on white bread, coated with egg and deep fried. :flag: Enter the Earth Day Facebook Sweepstakes for the chance to win a $250 gift card! http://woobox.com/vzud4e Exp 4/22/14 12P CST. :flag: Some of the best Pad Thai I've ever had.

And the lemonades are incredible! :flag: I wish one of the entr√©es was "Tons-and-Tons-O-Potstickers." :flag: Good food and nice place. :flag: We had great service. Okay food. Mango cocktail was okay but wish I'd gotten a drink with the in-house made ginger ale. :flag: Discount if you show them a room key from a nearby hotel :flag: Simply a great restaurant. Nice to go around brunch time but can be busy during late afternoons. Nice decor and fantastic asian food. :flag: Not the best chicken Pad thai in Chicago :flag: The food here's is really great! :flag: If you're an adventurous eater with no allergies or picky little requirements, ask your server/ bartender to surprise you. Not a bad dish on the menu. :flag: Spice your Meatless Monday up a little with Big Bowl's Spicy Thai Green Vegetable Curry. Guaranteed to add a kick to your day. :flag: Really slow service and inattentive servers. I wont go here if really hungry. You'll end up filling up with drinks. :flag: Big Bowl is nominated for Most Inspired Kids' Menu in our Hipsqueak Awards, vote now at timeoutchicagokids.com/awards! :flag: The best food!! Try a chefs dinner the next time you are there! You choose your protein and sauce!! :flag: The Steak and Noodles sauce is really salty. But the chicken pot stickers are delicious. :flag: Try the Soft Shell Crab Pad Thai :flag: Try the summer rolls :flag: Also, watch out! The veggie potstickers have peanuts in them. The menu DOESN'T warn you!! :flag: Stirfry chefs screwed up my order and gave my vegetables to my partner and vice versa. The food was okay once we got everything straightened out, but it's nothing I couldn't make at home. :flag: Get the Beef Lettuce wraps. :flag: Check in for the potstickers ~ they'll let you substitute any app, too! :flag: Fiery Chicken Dumplings to start. Thai hot pepper chicken as entree. Wash it down with a Sapporo or the local Three Floyd's on draft. :flag: Rude people work here. Not kid friendly. Skip it. :flag: The potstickers are a must! :flag: .......... :flag: free wifi! Free pot stickers! This place is great =) :flag: Our dessert on the house! :flag: Too awesome :flag: Luke N. is the best server ever ;) :flag: From left to right our ginger  ales: pomegranate , fresh squeezed orange, green tea, and passion fruit! :flag: Try the ginger ale! :flag: Order the chicken pad thai extra spicy, with extra egg, and extra lime wedges. :flag: AHW Seyval Blanc with the Panang Curry = amazeballs! :flag: Seems the Gluten free choice was a bit overwhelming with the orange flavor...also be careful with the extra spicy stuff. They go all in on spicy. Ginger ales were good. :flag: Beef lettuce wraps are great! Friendly servers and great food! :flag: Orange Chicken is always a safe bet from a Chinese restaurant that's owned by Chili's... :flag: The bathroom has the most AWESOME SINK EVER!! :flag: My favorite restaurant EVER :flag: Try the coconut pumpkin pie, its yummy! :flag: Order the pad thai extra hot for an awesome kick!  The spare rib appetizer is delish. :flag: Steak & noodles - A+++ :flag: literally the slowest service I've ever had. :flag: earth friendly & environmentally safe paper straws! :flag: pineapple sangria-yum! :flag: Big Bowl is 1 among more than 200 Illinois buildings & landmarks, 20 downtown hotels and 12 museums & theaters participating in Earth Hour 2011. Click "more info" to check-in :flag: Mediocre food and service. The shrimp and tea smoked pork was bland and there wasn't even salt or pepper on the table. :flag: They dont have bottled water, but the service is sub par and the food is not great. 20 minutes after we ordered they told us one of our meals was sold out, and that it sold out 30 mins ago...terrible :flag: Love the way Lettuce Entertain You restaurants handle their gluten free offerings. Also, used the Foursquare special and got a free ginger ale. Awesomeness. :flag: Create your own stir fry w/ salmon...best on the menu :flag: Heirloom Pork Meatballs: the best! :flag: Great spot for appetizers, drinks and dinner. They are running specials on their appetizers between 3-6 pm. I luv the chicken satay and chicken potstickers - especially with the plum sauce. Yum! :flag: Nice kids menu! Great price and value. They even have kids chopsticks! :flag: Chicken panang curry! THE best chicken curry I had in like ever!! :flag: I love the potstickers & chicken dumplings!

Awesome. :flag: The spicy sesame peanut noodles are amazing. :flag: Awesome Panang Curry Chicken. Hibiscus tea is great too!!! :flag: Addictive Kung pao beef and great dumpling noodle soup. :flag: Panang Curry is soooo yum. :flag: Vietnamese chicken noodle soup is a daily addiction here :flag: I've had the lettuce wraps here before & they're really good, but last night, I tried the shrimp pad thai, and it was just way too lemony for me! :flag: Go to Big Bowl and get the Panang Curry Chicken - it will change your life. :flag: Always get the kimchi üçü :flag: Lil Samurai and Hawaiian Pork tacos are both worth it. Great options for kids, too. :flag: Pork Belly tacos!! Fries, and Fried Grill Cheese. :flag: Try the Porkbelly Sandwich -  (via @Foodspotting) :flag: Try the Chili Cheese Fries -  (via @Foodspotting) :flag: Foie gras fries :flag: Very good tacos :flag: At BIG & little‚Äôs, you can load up on fried fish, burgers, po‚Äôboys of many stripes and tacos, but you really need to try the fries, be it the kimchi, Cajun or truffle, topped with an over-easy egg. :flag: Fried whitefish, cucumbers, carrots, pickled jalape√±os and‚Ä¶ actually, we don‚Äôt have time to list all the tangy, crunchy ingredients. You should be on your way to Big & Little‚Äôs--like right now. :flag: BYOB and utterly delicious. My favorite are the white fish tacos üòãüòã :flag: My food tasted as good as it looked :flag: Great food great staff great rustic Ambiance very comfortable we really enjoyed ourselves. We sampled the fish and chips crab po-boy and fish po-boy really delicious. Everything was so fresh and hot. :flag: The Hawaii 5.0 is my favorite burger in the city. Sweet and spicy. :flag: Never a dull taco! :flag: YES! Eat and be happy. Fish and chips amazing. Foie gras fries, best unreal value in Chi. Excellently executed fast food. Stop reading and GO. :flag: Fish tacos :flag: Cash only! :flag: Get the deep fried grilled cheese. Just do it. (PS cajun fries are also üíØ) :flag: Fried anything :flag: Burgers are amazing :flag: Very long wait during lunch time. About an hour to get food when I went. Worth it, though. :flag: The Al Pastor burger is hands down one of the best burgers in the city...it's that good. I've had it with bacon, the double, an egg, etc. They're all good! Make sure you get the truffle fries too. :flag: Generous portion of foie gras on the fries :flag: The shrimp taco was amazing :flag: Great tacos. I went mid afternoon and the service was very quick. :flag: Need more staff! :flag: SLOOOOW order taking time. :flag: Solid burger! :flag: Mack Daddy's = real life Big Macs :flag: Shrimp po boy, mahi taco, soft shell crab po boy :flag: Narrowing down one's options here can be difficult upon arrival. However, certainly save room for their Zeus Burger. Inside is seasoned lamb gyro meat, crumbled feta cheese, and an over easy egg. :flag: The large eclectic menu was overwhelming but the friendly staff, smoothed out the ordering process. We ordered tacos, burgers and poboys and no one was disappointed. :flag: Oh my the truffle fries....don't you dare leave without getting them. :flag: Fish and chips!! :flag: Seafood for a great price :flag: pork belly po boy is to die for. their foie gras fries are crazy good. tacos are good. nothing here isn't good and the guys are so friendly. :flag: The big n little taco & bahn mi po boy are fantastic :flag: The best fish tacos in Chicago with a large selection of different fish. The little samarai packs the perfect amount of heat. If your brave try the deep fried grilled cheese (it's surprisingly good). :flag: As if this place already wasn't going to be a hit based on the line outside, I was brought here with some coworkers for a bday. Wow the tacos are amazing. BBQ short rib or Bon Mi were great! :flag: There's a depth to the menu here that will keep you coming back to try new things. So far my favorites are the Hawaiian Pork Taco and the Mexican Beef Short Rib Taco. :flag: Truffle fries :flag: The raw ahi tuna taco is amazing! Especially on a hot day. All the other tacos are great as well. :flag: Stick with the tacos. The samurai will never do you wrong. :flag: Innovative tacos done well :flag: Shrimp Po Boy :flag: The crab po'boy has a whole crab on it! :flag: The foie gras with fries is "decadent" and medium-rare. The pork belly po' boy with maple mayo Guy described as "chicharrones meets pulled pork." Still hungry? Try the beer-battered fish and chips. :flag: 'BIG' hype, & 'little' to be desired. How did this place ever pass inspection? Great place for live entertainment (dining with flies). This place is a grease trap! Sorry. Two times, and never again. :flag: If you don't mind the wait, the Hawaii 5-0 is the best burger I've ever had. :flag: Truffle fries, shrimp tacos, spicy beef short rib taco are to die forüç¥ :flag: Try the truffle fries, po boys, and short rib tacos :flag: The samurai taco is the best! :flag: Decent. Hella expensive :flag: Long lines for lunch. Get fried fish tacos with a couple of sauces. Heavy meal but fun for a group. :flag: fish and chips were great!  Will go back again! :flag: Ask for advice on the specials. :flag: Ask for advice on the specials :flag: Get the beef taco, either style! :flag: Best food of the weekend visit!! :flag: short rib taco is the bomb.com!! :flag: Best Fish (1 giant filet) and Chips in the city. :flag: Pork belly Po'Boy was nice :flag: Egg burger is a go-to. :flag: Truffle fries. :flag: Foie gras fries weren't as good as advertised. We'll get the truffle next time. If you get a po boy, ask for a side of aioli. Fish & chips are 2 legit 2 quit. :flag: Soft shell crab po' boy. Getchu some :flag: Spicy short rib tacos with tapatio hot sauce! :flag: The fish tacos are delicious! I tried the samurai and the mahi mahi. Ordered 3 but they were larger than I expected - the tortillas are doubled up. The fries were really crispy. :flag: Grilled fish tacos!  Yum. Enjoy the summer weather at an outdoor table in their parking area! :flag: Poke tacos are a must :flag: Samurai taco and truffle fries! :flag: Get the Japanese short rib taco!  It was amazing! :flag: Samurai! Salmon Poke! Avoid the lunching hour. :flag: I was so happy with BIG & little's. Everything was very tasty -especially the little samurai.  Also, if you are in the mood for decadence, get the fois gras and fries.  SERIOUSLY, GET THEM! :flag: Deep Fried Grilled Cheese--at first glance, it looks much like a hole-less doughnut. But it's actually a sesame seed hamburger bun with American cheese and bacon slices, fried til golden and crispy. :flag: Fish taco was excellent! I also recommend the beer battered burger! :flag: Whitefish Poboys FTW!! :flag: What service! I had many questions while ordering and the cashier was nothing but helpful am patient. He also gave me a free taco on the house to try. Awesome. Go here. :flag: They dont have honkey poutine on the menu anymore but they made it when i asked for it.   So good :flag: Love love love the tacos. :flag: YUM!! Banh Mi taco was to-die-for. Must try in River North! :flag: Steamed Blue Crab Poke Taco, Burgers with Merkts Cheddar, Truffle Fries... Best meal ever! :flag: Its not good for you, but share a truffle fries or a honkey poutine with your friends :flag: Get yourself some Foie gras fries. :flag: Salmon Poke :flag: Trouffle fries :flag: Cash only but no worries they have a ATM :flag: Foie gras burger and truffle fries are the perfect combo! :flag: Ahi Pokƒì taco is out of this world. :flag: Get the Hercules Greek Burger!! I couldn't stop eating it to take a picture!! :flag: This quick-service fish shack is run by former Hell‚Äôs Kitchen contestant Tony D‚ÄôAlessandro. Standout fish is fried to order, burgers are made from Angus beef and the fries are larded with foie gras. :flag: Not a foodie place. I like foie gras, but this is disgusting and amazingly tasteless. :flag: Ahi taco not worth the $7 but the fried fish taco for $4 was excellent. :flag: Go right before "dinner" at like 5:30-6 and there always seems to be a seat...thereafter it picks up.  And their fish & chips can probably be shared as it's HUGE...although I don't...don't judge. :flag: In the last 3 months. Fingers fat from all the sodium. :flag: Solid food. Was better before their seventh price raise I'm the last 3 months :flag: The soft shell crab poboy is great. It's a whole crab! :flag: Bring cash only. The softshell crab poboy rocks! :flag: Just remember, cash only... :flag: Wicked good!  Only one veggie option tho, a portobello burger. :flag: The Ahi & Salmon Pokes are amazing :flag: samurai whitefish taco is great. :flag: BYOB. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The crab tostada is a personal favorite. Always check out the burger of the day. :flag: Fried Grilled Cheese is a little greasy. But the Hawaii Five-O burger was great :flag: Fish and chips, po' boys, fish tacos, and um, foie gras ries, all churned out of an inconspicuous shack just west of the Brown Line. :flag: Worth the wait and money. Just make sure they know youre here so you don't get skipped :flag: Pass on the shrimp po' boy & go for shrimp & chips instead. Sandwich bread was fairly hard & although the portion was generous, it was difficult to eat with just your hands. Try the truffle fries too. :flag: Foie gras fries are great. :flag: They just moved one block south and to the west side of the street to a considerably bigger location. Don't fret if you don't see a sign at their old location.. you're close. :flag: I'm fairly certain it's not on the menu, so make sure to order the spicy aioli with your food :flag: Fried smelt and or soft shell crab po'boy... Your arteries will hate you, but everything else will fall madly in love with this decision! :flag: Foie Gras fries!!! :flag: Fried shrimp taco's & truffle fries.  Enough said. :flag: New location is sweeet! But I almost passes it as the signs in the window. Super bonus is having a parking lot! :flag: They just moved south a couple blocks to 860 N. Orleans. Bigger. Better. :flag: They've moved 1blk south. More seating and parking :flag: On an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, Guy Fieri made the trip to this tiny Chicago joint, where the shrimp is battered and fried to order. :flag: Order the Foie Gras Fries, hand-cut beauties that have a crisp exterior and soft interior and are bursting with fresh potato flavor. The foie gras was flawlessly cooked with a nice crust. :flag: Awesome food...crab tostada, tilapia taco, shrimp po boy yummy! Very tiny, no A/C, no ice or bathroom available...so take it to go. :flag: The Burger w Merkts Cheese is awesome.  Fried Talapia Fish Tacos are really, really good also :flag: Shrimp po boy :flag: Fried squid tacos!!! :flag: Incredible place right down the street! Get the Shrimp Po'Boy! :flag: Try the crab tostada you can't go wrong. :flag: Truffle fries. Done. :flag: If you drive here, they have a lot in the back that you can park in for free :flag: Soft Shell crab, shrimp and crawfish po boys on the specials menu! :flag: Unbelievable. If you come here get the foie gras and fries. If you hate foie gras,  get the FOIE GRAS........  Also every taco is amazing.  Seriously get here quick!!! :flag: Lunch = 2 Tacos  and Dinner = 3 Tacos (Shrimp is the best then Mahi then the standard fish) Can't go wrong with a side of truffle fries. :flag: Foie Gras & Fries :flag: Try the Mahi Tacos! :flag: Bring cash becuase it's all these guys take :flag: try the fish tacos :flag: Truly a hidden gem of River North- definitely not what I expected. Gourmet food at fast food prices, reggae music, and a laid back atmosphere. It's amazing. Try the fish & chips and the fish tacos. :flag: echo the crab tostada love and the shrimp tacos are great too :flag: Get the crab tostada and fries.... heck... get one of everything These guys know what they're doing! Fresh ingredients, simple and elegant composition, and only a light dent in the wallet. :flag: Foie gras and fries is a must! :flag: Don't forget that it's cash only! :flag: New culinary-minded "fast food"...Hell's Kitchen contestant Tony D'Alessandro behind the stove. Awesome! :flag: The burgers are good, and the big cookies are good and the bacon Mac and ice cream :flag: Every now and then a Togarashi Bowl (baked tofu, grilled kale, carrots, pickled radish, scallion, seaweed, sesame seeds over purple rice with a lemon tahini miso dressing) really hits the spot. :flag: Jackfruit tacos are amazing. :flag: They have an "employee plate" which is like a daily special. Sometimes it's a sandwich, sometimes it's more of a plate like ribs with a salad. Either way you can't go wrong. :flag: Tiny little place if you want to dine in (8 chairs), but this place is a treat for vegans and a surprise for non-vegans :flag: Always ask what the employee meal is! They whip up some amazing things not on the menu. :flag: Best vegan waffles in town :flag: An accurate name for what is basically the break room for Upton's employees, it's cool getting to grab a great vegan meal directly from the source. :flag: Excellent vegan lunch; the Kimchi Tacos are wonderful! :flag: The Fried Bacon Mac is brimming with bacon-flavored seitan, crunchy panko and a faux cheese as warm and comforting as the real deal. :flag: I like my food free of animal AND human products: Upton's satisfied the former but not the latter. Hair in my tempeh sandwich. Ick. :flag: The breakfast sandwich and blueberry muffin were so good! Place is tiny but it is all vegan :-) :flag: Courtesy Veg*n Chicago by Amy Graff :flag: The fried bacon mac at Upton‚Äôs Breakroom is one of the 100 best things we ate this year. http://tmout.us/rLOtk :flag: I would have appreciated a side and a wider variety of beverages, but the BLT was tasty. :flag: Best scone of my life?! :flag: Only seating for 8 :flag: All vegan and tasty :flag: The ceiling started leaking...then it became a waterfall through the ceiling..,right next to our table. Security and staff were rude. Food was ok. I wouldn't go back. Music was the best part. :flag: Dim lighting and lots flats screens! Lively & trendy atmosphere that is good for groups or a date! Tuna tartar, steak tartar and nachos are delicious appetizers to share! :flag: I had the charred ny steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. No salt or sauce required! Service and ambience was outstanding. :flag: The truffle Mac and cheese is amazing :flag: Not a bad bar, nothing special though. The sliders were pretty tasty. :flag: If you want to go to the worst place in Chicago, then head here. :flag: Trendy and affordable but it can get really loud. Be prepared to shout or sit close to hear. :flag: Friendly service, casual atmosphere :flag: SteakBar is new and trending this week! This upscale steakhouse features hearty entre√©s, a raw bar, and a variety of wine, craft beer, and cocktails. :flag: Awesome ambiance. Definitely the most upscale place in old town :flag: The turkey burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and their fries are awesome! :flag: The burgers are excellent.  The single was plenty.  And the buns are soft and buttery.  Would definitely come back :flag: Fr√≠es, burgers and milkshake :flag: The place is empty and somehow it takes 20 minutes to cook a burger patty. Real efficient staff here. :flag: Look for summer issue we may do a food write up on this place. They play great reggae music :flag: Check in before you pay or they "can't" give you your free fries :flag: The new skinny shakes are ridiculously good! Kudos! :flag: Beware of exploding ketchup bottles! :flag: It may be kinda good, but over $10 for a burger w/ cheese (up charge for the cheese), small fries, small drink is ridiculous!!! :flag: EAT the Portabella Sandwich :flag: The cashier Mikeisha was arrogant, she wouldn't let me finish talking when I was trying to give her my order. Too pricey for this type of service. :flag: Get the Milk & Honey shake, delicious! :flag: somewhat over priced..THICK Bacon, epic sauce is good tastes like big mac sauce/1000island :flag: Their shakes and malts are the best! :flag: Get the epic burger with bacon and grilled onions - delicious!! :flag: Save your money and go around the corner to Johnny's or J's for a burger. :flag: They have beers available in 100oz sizes. Comes with a spout and you can get 8-9 beers out of it :flag: This is a very cool bar with lots of TV's all over. The waiter wasn't the most helpful, just know what you want to order when you get here :flag: Service always kicks ass here. :flag: Sunday night football beer specials. :flag: Always a lively crowd at Big Bar! Drinks are priced like any other hotel bar. Good view with huge panoramic Windows.

Great drinks. Time to party. :flag: Nachos and Gold Coast cocktails are delish!! :flag: Ask for the snack mix.  Spicy goodness but it seems they keep it on the down low. :flag: Oddly reminiscent of the club in Tati's Playtime... :flag: Nice view. Good location. :flag: Try the Tavern Sliders Trio - #hrtechconf #hrevolution pre marathon meal :flag: Absolutely the WORST "old fashioned" I've ever had! They add water to the drink :-( :flag: The big margarita is not worth buying. It's big, but taste just like juice...what a waste! :flag: Try the Ommegang Abbey Ale if they have it on menu when you come here. SO GOOD! :flag: Try the Margarita - Huge drinks! :flag: $9 for a shot of Rumple Minze? Please! :flag: Beer is nice and icy cold.  View looking north is cool. :flag: Sit at the bar for the best services. :flag: paradise sunset martini! :flag: Service here is ridiculously slow. They leave so much money on the table! They should be prepared for large groups. :flag: Shrimp cocktail with the horseradish is amazing to share between people. very romantic. :flag: Get the big drinks. Mango daiquiri, pina colada and big blue are the best. 44 oz. Do not take on an empty stomach. :flag: Very Big drinks are totally worth the price! :flag: Salmon tacos a good meal - especially with a tall beer. :flag: Great filter coffee, lovely matcha latte with almond milk. They also have some cupping sessions worth to try! :flag: Good cap but didn‚Äôt care for the pour over. Too dark for my taste. :flag: Joshua is super nice & anyone willing to put up with my obnoxious comments is sweet! Great product selection also! :flag: Samantha is the best and is so helpful.

Como todos recomiendan... prueben el Lobster Mac n Cheese y como plato fuerte Bone in Kona :flag: Nothing ever changes, and that's exactly as it should be. My pick: bone-in NY strip with gorgonzola and truffle, or the same steak with a Kona crust.

De lo mejor que he comido. :flag: The Kona crusted filet mignon is delicious.

For lunch: the lobster bisque or the lobster & crab cakes are not published on the menu, under 500 calories and still so decadent. :flag: Truly wonderful old fashioned service. Great cocktails, amazing steaks and humongous sides. Caleb (waiter) is a treasure and a marvellous guide for the menu. :flag: Menu at lunch 18$: claim chowder (or French onion soup) + Dry aged sirloin.

Tried ahi ... they did a huge version ... dry. (Service at the bar is FIRST RATE.) :flag: Great filet and king crap! :flag: You know when you're full and you still keep eating? That's this place!

Stoli dole. Amazing! :flag: Get the peppercorn steak. :flag: Ask for Phil DeSisto.  *Wonderful* service, knowledgeable and professional gentleman. :flag: Kona steak & Oscar filet were amazing! Prosciutto mozzarella app was also great! Creme br√ªl√©e was perfect. Lobster Mac & cheese was not as amazing as I thought it would be.

It's big enough to share, but you may not want to. :flag: Get the proscuitto wrapped mozzarella and the Stoli Doli. Their burgers are awesome too. :flag: Don't pass on the french fries here, they're top notch. :flag: Ask for Vanya to be your server :flag: Almost all sides come in half orders.... :flag: get the porchini rub delmonico :flag: Best BBQ in the city.  I‚Äôm partial to the sliced brisket and my first choice in sides is the potato salad but have not been disappointed with anything there. :flag: Great food and excelente live music. A must Go in Chicago!!! :flag: Sliced brisket! :flag: St.Louis ribs were great..meaty, smoky, trimmed perfectly and moist. Brisket was melt in your mouth tender. Highly recommended !! :flag: Nationally amongst best BBQ ever had. Slaw is the best I've ever had. The bar for all briskets. Sauces have perfect levels of smoke, sweet and tang. Wait is decent if you go off hours. :flag: Had the brisket, corn bread, and French fries. The brisket was so tender I had a hard time picking it up with my fork. By far the best I've had in a long time. Definitely recommend this place. :flag: Brisket and pulled pork are good. Get the platter with cole slaw and fries. They don't serve beer. :flag: My favorite BBQ in the city. Good ribs and side dishes. :flag: Slice brisket, ribs are tender, juicy and delish!!! :flag: Everything smoked is a hit here. Recommended! :flag: Although not old school, Smoque is king for BBQ in Chicago. It's impossible to go wrong here but first timers should stick to ribs and mac & cheese. (But my personal favorite is the pulled pork) :flag: Great place! Don't let the interior deceive you. Their meat is unbelievably tasty! :flag: Pulled pork! :flag: It's all good just don't forget the cowboy candy :flag: The mac and cheese at Smoque gets back to basics with simple elbow macaroni and plenty of cheddar, baked in a deep foil tin to keep the noodles hot until the last bite. :flag: thay have the coleslaw without Onion! The Babybacks are the best in Chicago & the brisket melts in your mouth :flag: Wow. Maybe the best BBQ I've ever had. :flag: Get the St. Louis style wings...great French fries :flag: The brisket is fantastic, but everything else is overrated. The ribs were like eating charcoal, Coleslaw full of vinegar. Maybe It's because I recently came back from Kansas City, j wasn't impressed. :flag: The brisket is good and the platter comes with coleslaw and 2 sides. :flag: Everything! :flag: Speechless. :flag: 10 - Unreal barbecue. One of the best, hands down. :flag: The ribs and brisket are really good :flag: Best brisket I have had outside of Texas/OK/Kansas area. Baby back ribs were tasty too! I like my ribs dry so I really like the fact that they put the sauce on the side. Parking very limited. :flag: With two smokers to prep meaty St. Louis-style ribs, tender brisket, apple-and-oak-smoked pulled pork and more, this 'cue joint ain't no joke. :flag: Brisket is amazing. Everything is, really. :flag: BBQ Brisket :flag: The bread pudding is to die for :flag: Brisket is on point. BYOB is a huge plus. :flag: One of the best! Especially for front porch sessions ‚Äîwhen you need a good BBQ place to discuss your record finds while having your favorite beer. BYOB! :flag: This neighborhood favorite serves wood-smoked meats flavored with house-made Memphis-style rubs and tangy barbecue sauce for barbecue ribs that are finger-licking good. :flag: Great experience with catering. :flag: Smoque just catered my party. The food was delicious. They were on time and polite. The customer service from the beginning to end was excellent.  I highly recommend. :flag: RIBS ARE AWESOME!! :flag: Hands down the contenders have not come close. I had high hopes for Dinosaurs, but the Smoque Texas sausage along with the beef brisket kills it! :flag: BBQ ribs are the best! Surprisingly Mac & cheese is great too! :flag: BBQ, is meat and they do it right. :flag: The brisket is so delicious - melts in your mouth.

Corn bread and fries were ok. :flag: Thrillist Top BBQ List: Any doubts about their attention to detail will be put to rest in their epic BBQ Manifesto, and by a peppery, tender bite of brisket followed up with a meaty pork spare rib. :flag: Amazing brisket!! :flag: Hey Smoque BBQ, you should join Freebie! The benefits are amazing for both you and me. :flag: The best smoked chicken anywhere... And their brisket is amazing also :flag: Does ribs are mouthwatering....and the fries and pudding just wonderful. :flag: Ribs,brisket, sides, slaw :flag: Sauce is secondary at this barbecue spot where simplicity is best. The pork is rubbed down with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and other spices, and then smoked for 13 to 14 hours. :flag: Best BBQ in Chicago. :flag: The ribs sampler (1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis) was awesome. Cole slaw and mac & cheese are very good, but the pecan bourbon bread pudding is the best I've ever had. :flag: Brisket, Memphis-style and Carolina-style sauce, mmmm :flag: Buy the brisket and the pulled pork by the pound.  It's that good. :flag: The brisket. The ribs. The Mac-N-Cheese. The smoky baked beans. The slaw. It's all incredible... :flag: I'm from Texas, so I know BBQ. Smoque is probably the best BBQ place in the city. Their brisket and pork ribs are where its at. About 15 bucks will get you an entr√©e two sides and a drink. BYOB. :flag: Everything is amazing. Even down to the cole slaw with the sweet/sour vinegar. :flag: Check out Smoque as seen on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives :flag: I know this will not be helpful, but you cannot go wrong with any choices here, be it smoked meat, sauces, or sides. Sorry, you are on your own to make a decision. :flag: Tony Mantuano, chef of Spiaggia, eats here on his nights off. He loves the Brisket. :flag: Had the ribs, amazing, and can't wait to return for the famous brisket! And byob too! :flag: I love the brisket! :flag: Love the beef brisket! dip it with bun in BBQ sauce üòã :flag: Everything is good. But get the sliced brisket :flag: Best brisket north of Austin :flag: Best BBQ in Chicago.

I hold into the Carolina sauce for too long and put it on everything. :flag: Brisket sliced :flag: This is the epitome of what brisket should taste like! It's the best I've ever eaten. I shed a tear just thinking about its perfection. The BBQ is a perfectly sweet and tangy. Get Mac and cheese too! :flag: Brisket was a little dry today :( :flag: The most tender brisket I've ever eaten :flag: Brisket is awesome! :flag: Everything is electric smoked.  It is not real bbq.  Being from the south it is blasphemous this is called some of the best bbq. :flag: Best brisket in Chicago, tender, juicy. :flag: In addition to the main plates, all the sides are delicious.  Cole slaw, chili, peach cobbler. :flag: After 14hrs in the smoker, their moist and tender brisket with a two-layer spice rub and house BBQ sauce finds its way into... more customer's stomachs than any other Smoque offering. :flag: Good brisket and ribs... :flag: BYOB! Expect to wait on the weekends for a table. :flag: Okay. So if you actually love ribs and brisket and BBQ sauce then this is the place for you. DON'T bring anyone with you who doesn't like BBQ to Smoque because they will just ruin your day. :flag: Just don't go on Sundays, or make sure to call ahead for carry out :flag: I haven't tried every plate but the platter with a heap of samples was awesome. My BBQ brisket sandwich was on point :flag: Call ahead or prepare to wait. Either way, the best BBQ in the city! :flag: The portions aren't large, and it's pretty far from downtown, but the food is phenomenal. :flag: One word: "brisket" enough said period!!! :flag: The brisket cemita by Cemitas Puebla and Smoque BBQ is one of the 100 best things we ate this year. http://tmout.us/rLOtk :flag: Delicious brisket and amazing sides!

That way, I can order ahead using "appay"!!!!!!!! :flag: Try the St. Louis Baby Back Ribs :flag: The baby back ribs & pulled pork sandwich-5 stars!!!!! :flag: Brisket all day! :flag: The best smoked brisket ever! :flag: Absolutely amazing brisket sandwich. It was so flavorful and you could literally taste the smoke. :flag: A pulled pork sandwich truly done right - huge hunks of meat on a delicious bun. A nearly perfect sauce. Points deducted for the coleslaw though, it's more like an onion salad. :flag: Ask for the spicy BBQ sauce, which I found tastier than the regular. Take advantage of the "Add a Taste" menu to maximize your sampling. Great food and service! :flag: This place isn't all that! There's alot of better places in the city! And aloy cheaper too! :flag: Good food! Just expect to wait lol :flag: So good. Lived up to expectations. Left wanting more. Ughhhh :flag: The St. Louis ribs, mac 'n' cheese, and peach cobbler are must haves!

I'll make this a normal eating spot! :flag: Like little the pizza joint you will leave here saying , BRISKET , BRISKET, BRISKET....!!!!! :flag: In a city with many BBQ places, smoque reigns as the best. I have traveled to most of the renowned BBQ places from KC to Texas to Memphis and the Carolina's and no place comes as close as this one :flag: Brisket is totally incredible. You won't be disappointed. :flag: Best BBQ in Chicago. That's a Fact. :flag: The brisket is very tender and awesome.  Texas sausage is pretty good.  I will say that Sweet Baby Rays has better pork, better buns better cornbread, and much much much better sauce.  :-) :flag: Closed on Monday's! Boo that! :flag: My wife and visited from Austin, and I am a BBQ snob,, and I can clearly say this is the best sliced brisket I have EVER had. Ever. :flag: Brisket is the shit, wish the sides were bigger, but smaller sides that taste great are better then larger portions of crap like Pork Shoppe. :flag: Come earlier to get a table. Oh and the cornbread is amazing! :flag: Some of the best BBQ you've had made by a series of guys who set out to cross BBQ borders and blend styles. Get a platter and add a taste of everything else.

And get the Memphis sauce for tour fries. :flag: Can't miss this BBQ extravaganza! ;o)  Everything is delicious here! :flag: Now you can buy a bottle of their bbq sauce. Original or spicy. :flag: Barbecue is no joke in Chicago! Smoque BBQ, with its righteous Texas-style barbecue fits in deliciously well. Don't forget to check out the 14-hour smoked BBQ at Cellular Field as well. - Inspector :flag: Brisket is good, sliced. Mac n chz, yummy. Key to this place, call ahead and pick up. No wait. :flag: Damn good brisket!  Get it both chopped & sliced! :flag: Brisket is very good, but no rib tips? You ain't a BBQ joint without tips...... if you like hot BBQ sauce I guess you'll enjoy it.. good BBQ but not the best in CHICAGO. :flag: Barbecue lovers swear by the magic of Smoque, which manages to draw consistent lines despite the fact it's a schlep and a half away in Irving Park. :flag: I am not partial to the ribs they are not to moist fall off the bone type that I like. :flag: It's BYO. But these guys are dedicated to their craft. Discard your judgements about the community seating. This is a serious joint for gourmet eating. :flag: Best BBQ in the city.

Try it. :flag: It may sound odd, but the #14 salmon burger with ginger and sriracha Asian slaw is the best. We had the  #5 bison burger and #4 pepper /egg / bacon burger and both were far from the salmon. :flag: With this spot being rated #3 burger in Chicago I was definitely expecting more. Very thin patty, twice as much bread. The bacon they put on after they forgot was quite cold & crispy. :flag: Super good burgers :flag: For a boost of flavor, each bite of mac and cheese was laced with the unmistakable, but never overpowering, funk of truffle oil. :flag: The burgers here are excellent. I would highly recommend getting the sweet potato fries with the aioli sauce. :flag: Onion strings are the side of choice. :flag: Good veggie burgers - made with a black bean base. Don't skip out on the fries or onion strings! :flag: Slightly different take on the burger; served on artisan buns, egg option, bread & butter pickles, etc. Unique-ish menu + one of the better burgers in the neighborhood. Get larger size fries for sure. :flag: DMK is a go-to for good reason. Among the memorable hand-cut Russets are those doused in Parmesan and truffle cream. Then again, the sweet potato fries with Tabasco-lemon aioli are pretty good, too. :flag: Get the cheese fries! ! :flag: Great burgers, I especially enjoy the bison with goat cheese, pickled onions, and blueberry bbq sauce. :flag: The bison burger was incredible and the truffle fries are a must :flag: The Big DMK Burger is knife-and-fork big, especially with a fried egg, and it makes for a very satisfying dinner with side orders of chili-rubbed onion strings (great house ketchup) and fries. :flag: Literally everything here is amazing. :flag: Great burger and sides.   No customizations allowed.  Music in the restaurant was too loud to have any good conversation. :flag: Perfect salmon burger! I loved it! :flag: S'mores milkshake is SUMMER NIGHTS in a cup. Totally turned my winter blues upside down. :flag: Burgers, parmesan truffle fries, Pineapple basil soda :flag: The burgers are amazing but vegetarians beware: the fries are cooked in animal fat. :flag: Burgers are very, very good. But go after those sides and sauces! We went when they had a monthly special of sweet potato tots with a special aioli sauce that was unreal. Long wait, but worth it. :flag: fries are cooked in beef fat--vegetarians and vegans beware :flag: DMK burger & parmesan fries :flag: Nope. Good, creative and pricey but not in top 10. Fries are done correctly and exquisitely. Try the fish! :flag: #6 for life :flag: Great ambience and food and staff. Everything! :flag: DMK's vegetarian burger boasts a veggie-and-grain patty, aged cheddar, eggplant, tomato and pesto mayo. :flag: An underrated burger bar. I actually like DMK better than Kuma's. Great home-made buns, great fries, good craft beers. :flag: It's hard to find a really great bison burger, but DMK does an excellent job! :flag: Delicious burgers, fries, shakes, and local beer :flag: The #4 is the best thing on the menu. You can't go wrong with deviled eggs either. :flag: Great burgers, fries & cocktails. If you like spicy get the #4! :flag: Best cocktails here: the respect your elders and the some candy talking. Pic is the latter. :flag: Delicious burgers for everyone. Try the salmon burger. Try some different types of fries. Good beer selection. :flag: OMG!!

We had to sit at the bar to eat, and our waiter/bartender went out of his way to make sure we were properly tended to. High marks. :flag: Truffle fries :flag: The burgers are good not amazing but the parmesan truffle cream fries with lemon sauce are to die for. Great beer selection. :flag: https://www.beermenus.com/places/9713-dmk-burger-bar-lakeview :flag: For something on the lighter side, try the fresh salmon "burger" at DMK Burger Bar. It's made with fresh ginger and scallions, topped with an Asian slaw tossed with a red Thai curry sauce. :flag: Burgers are a bit thin but the quality of the meat is really good. Fries are incredible. Truffle fries are so delicious . Make sure to get the large order! :flag: The potato fries are super creative. Edgy place with a good taste for burger lovers! :flag: Yes, the burgers are good. I refuse to go anymore because it is so outrageously loud that you have to yell to be heard by the person sitting next to you. It's a shame, because the fries are great. :flag: Try the bison burger number 5 with goat cheese and caramelized onions. :flag: Ordered #4; burgers, egg, cheese, chiles. Also the cheddar fries with scallions. Both had amazing flavor. Bottom bun a little soggy but totally enjoyed it. Lettuce may have been the solution. :flag: The bison burger is great. All the fries are awesome but the parm are my favorite. Get a couple small sizes to share. :flag: The fries are amazing. Try two varieties! :flag: Always order the wasbi coleslaw and add it to your burger for a cold kick!!! :flag: Try the roasted hatch green chili burger, it's awesome!! :flag: The bun will melt in your mouth unlike any other bun you've had on a sandwich of the same sort. :flag: They're serious with their mac & cheese so if you're also serious, get the Mac & Cheese #2, it has Gruyere, smoked bacon and charred balsamic red onions! :flag: Check out DMK Burger Bar as seen on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives :flag: Pick a number, any number. All are delicious. Then add an egg and do the sweet potato fries. :flag: Really good burger. :flag: #6 Guacamole Burger :flag: Henry's swing club last week, DMK tonight #dmkoozie :flag: Grass fed burgers and really good fries! They don't take reservations though :flag: Show up early or they may never seat you or know you're even there. :flag: Shut the front door and grab one of these burger. I'm headed home from work right now and I'm going to stop in for one. Definitely a top ten burger in the city. :flag: I have been here 3 times in a row, 2 times I sent my burger back. Over cooked burgers. too many kids who scream. I don't know if its a burger bar or a high school cafeteria. :flag: Great beer selection, excellent burgers and fries. Wait time can be long, so try to go late night or on off days. :flag: The Bison Burger is delicious. :flag: The lamb burger! :flag: Amazing beer selection! :flag: On the lighter side, this fresh salmon burger is made with fresh ginger and scallions, and topped with an Asian slaw tossed with red Thai curry sauce. :flag: Peanut butter shake, sweet potato fries & the #5 (Bison burger w/ blueberry BBQ sauce on a pita bun) Yum! The deviled eggs are delish too! :flag: Awesome veggie burger !

Great food, great service, gets pretty packed so get there early on weekend nights!! :flag: good service n food ,, :flag: Awesome place with awesome milk shakes try one! :flag: #6 burger is absolutely amazing :flag: Truffle Fries were addicting.

Best side on the menu. :flag: Add me to the list of folks that love the Bison Burger with goat cheese‚Äé, pickled red onion and blueberry bbq sauce. :flag: Turkey burger was awesome. Definitely worth stopping in! :flag: The burgers come out super fast but they are oh so delicious. Get the #5. :flag: Fries were good, but next time be sure to ask them to hold the salt. They over salt the fries too much. Turkey burger was excellent! Definitely recommend it. :flag: Holy shit, the milkshake. I don't even like milkshakes. Get a milkshake. (Veggie burgers are alright- I wouldn't call it the best) :flag: Rocked! Lilly was great waitress, and burgers, beer and good were money! :flag: Yum yum yummyness #1 was savory and sweet... Just great. Our favorite side was the onion strings. :flag: Must try the #5 Buffalo Burger. Awesomeness! Service wqs top drawer as well. :flag: Good food and great people. The hostess gave us fries on the house because our table took a little longer than expected. On top of the great service, the salmon and veggie burger were delicious. :flag: Turkey burger was the best I've ever had and the fries were the icing on the cake. Plus they served Crispin apple cider, one of my favorites! :flag: The Patrick Kane. Go Hawks!!! :flag: So good you won't want ketchup.  Get the #5 bison burger - it has (subtlety flavored) blueberry BBQ sauce :flag: They should make their items order-able from my smart phone by adding them to the app "appay biz". That way, I can order ahead using "appay"!! :flag: Effe is the best! Always suggesting great food & drinks. Tip her well! :flag: Hey I got free fries for checking in with Foursquare.

EVER. :flag: I'm sure you aren't coming here because you're a vegetarian, but if you do the fries are fried in beef fat. The fried onion thing is awesome though. :flag: Great music and the margaritas are fantastic! :flag: I pray to the double Bison Burger w/ fried egg and shredded crispy onions. :flag: Try the #5. Trust me. :flag: The #3 is basically a Reuben on a burger (pastrami, gruyere cheese, sauerkraut, and an unbelievable remoulade). If you're into this type of thing, don't hesitate to pull the trigger. :flag: #4 never disappoints!

Our waitress didn't even introduce herself and it really wasn't that busy.. even if it was Halloween night. :flag: Try the parmesan fries! :flag: The fries (fried in beef fat), shakes or sides, like anchovy-draped Caesar salad, steal the show from the burger.

Bison burger w goat cheese isn't bad, either. :flag: They just started offering LeftHand Nitro Milk Stout on tap! One of my favz! :flag: Weirdly small plates used for the burgers. I kinda dig the music and I really liked the lemon alioli used for the sweet potato fries. Wish burger bun was more toasted. :flag: The #4 is a grass-fed patty with roasted hate green chile , sonoma jack cheese, and a fried egg. It's awesomeness on a pretzel bun :flag: Pretty mediocre for all the hype/price. Can get the exact same cheese fries at wieners circle and pay less for more.

Even though we took the special Kuma's burger it was tasteless and I didn't like it. A bit disappointed üòî :flag: Best burgers in the city served with metal music, excellent beer and no remorse. Band-themed burgers are monstrous and dripping with toppings. If you're really hungry, get some Mac & cheese to share. :flag: Good burgers!!! :flag: Burgers but the chili I am not a personal fan of. :flag: Mac and cheese :flag: Burgers are always great, but mac and cheese is nothing to be sneezed at. Enough to take home for days! :flag: Kuma's Corner bills its build-your-own mac and cheese as an appetizer, but it's big enough to feed you and a few of your headbanger friends.¬† :flag: The meat on any burger tastes so good! :flag: Voted best üçî in Chicago for good reason! :flag: Everything is delicious. The veggie burgers are hand made daily. The YOB with smoked Gouda, garlic mayo and add grilled pineapple! Best tunes to gain a happy belly ü§òüèª :flag: Great spot! Lazer snake and anti-hero with the Pantera burger were a great combo! :flag: Metal + burgers. I mean. Do it. :flag: Menu is amazing. Everything named after metal bands. Metal themed place, even the staff looks like they live at a concert permanently. Beer list is extensive. Best burger I've ever had by far. :flag: Our burgers sucked..the pretzel bun was cold. And our fries looked promising but none were crispy..just soggy oily potatoes. Sorry this place is way overrated. :flag: Burgers on the best pretzel bun :flag: Slayer, calamari, whiskey on tap :flag: The best burger I have ever had. :flag: "This burger demands a commitment. Once you pick it up, you won't put it down (and not just because its toppings practically spill out as you eat)."- Andrew Zimmerman :flag: "The ultimate chef-metalhead combo for me is the Metallica Burger at Kuma. This thick, perfectly cooked burger on a toasted pretzel roll satisfies any foodie."- Rick Tramonto :flag: Their fried pickles were among the best I've had. Their hand-made veggie patties were really good. :flag: Get the YOB! :flag: Metallica (burnt) :flag: Kuma's crazy BLT sandwich is named after the punk band APMD, which stands for "all pigs must die." And it's quite an accurate name considering this sandwich contains more bacon than anything! :flag: Anything you get will be amazing. :flag: Every burger here is amazing! :flag: Mmmm, good! Get the buffalo patty! :flag: Beer, Burgers :flag: Kuma's Corner is said to serve some of the best burgers in Chicago, like their Pantera or Plague Burgers! Get the Jack cheese on a pretzel bun while you wait and listen to the killer metal music. :flag: Las hamburguesas son grandes y de calidad pero no son tan increibles :flag: Great burgers and mac&cheese :flag: Absu burger is so great :flag: Heavy metal burgers! They are massive so be prepared to have your faces melted off! Their burgers of the month are always pretty creative and tasty. Try the Led Zeppelin w/ pulled pork and bacon! \m/ :flag: Never disappointed!!! :flag: That Lair of the Minotaur and the Neurosis are my favorites! :flag: Be prepared to wait to be seated... carryout available during the winter. :flag: The Iron Maiden burger is pretty good. :flag: Great burgers, but do not miss the Mac and cheese this is to order and fresh not good for reheat, sauce breaks. Eat all the Mac and take 1/2 the burger home and eat outta da fridge at midnight! :flag: Russian Circle Burgers were amazing! :flag: Hey Kuma's Corner, you should join Freebie! It‚Äôs pretty rad and the benefits are great for both you and me. Check it out! http://taps.io/freebie :flag: Fun atmosphere and great food. The Ministry burger was amazing and Stephanie, are server, was fantastic. We'll definitely be back :flag: The MetaL and the burgers :flag: It's legendary, and for good reason. You can't go wrong with any burger, and don't miss out on the Mac & Cheese. Check the tap list for killer craft beer from 3 Floyds, Revolution & others. :flag: "The Slayer Burger is a 10oz. patty on a bed of fries, chili, cherry peppers, caramelized onion, andouille sausage, shredded monterrey jack, green onion, and ANGER!"  Also, delicious. :flag: Metal bar with the best burgers. Try the kuma burger! :flag: Everything :flag: Great lunch yesterday. üòã :flag: Just get any burger. You won't be disappointed. :flag: Burgers and beers :flag: Great burgers!!! Try the YOB burger. :flag: Everything :flag: Great burger! Will definitely be visiting again when in the area. :flag: ABSU burger for the win! :flag: The best burger in Chi-town, complete with egg on top. :flag: Fantastic burgers. And quite a beer selection too. It's a popular place so be prepared for a wait. :flag: Its the BOMB!!!  @markmod4040 :flag: Hands down BEST burgers anywhere. Fantastic beer list. You will not find a better burger. :flag: Great burgers :flag: Best burgers I've had anywhere. Hands down. Try the Pantera üëå :flag: Plague Bringer burger and The Yob are both amazing burgers. The Caesar salad was really good as well! :flag: Great burger and criss cuts!  Whiskey on tap if you must! :flag: Go for the Burgers, baby! :flag: The Slayer is an insane pile of meat, fries, and everything but the kitchen sink. It is both delicious and overwhelming. :flag: The Mac and cheese is killer! :flag: The Slayer listed on Food Networks "Best. Burger. Ever." :flag: Be prepared for a wait! In the winter, due to a small kitchen and inability to leave the front door open, it does get quite smokey. Get the Kuma's burger and the Jalepeno Poppers. :flag: I thought that burgers were really good but I don't consider them the best burger joint in Chicago. :flag: Heavy metal: Check. Bigger than life burgers: Check. Beers&bourbon: Check. What else can u ask 4? Do your ears, throat & stomach a favor and visit this place. Attention: keep some stomach space empty! :flag: Long wait but slightly overrated when you consider the meat to bun ratio. Rather dry burger :flag: Everything. :flag: Burgers, beer :flag: I usually get the SLAYER burger, fries are pretty awesome too! :flag: One of the best burger joints in chicago. A lot of heavy metal stuff. :flag: The veggie burger was yummy ABSU style. I am conflicted between here and Lockdown. They are both good in there own different ways. :flag: ORDER: Plague Bringer. This aggressively large burger rests atop a garlic mayo-slathered pretzel roll. On top of that, fresh crushed garlic, melted pepperjack cheese and jalapeno tortilla strips. :flag: Insane wait, insane burgers. The plague bringer is great. Try and get a place at the bar :flag: Burgers and Beer. :flag: Black saboth burger...rocks and better than a raw bat :flag: Check out Kuma's Corner as seen on Best Thing I Ever Ate , Burger Land , Diners, Drive-ins and Dives , Food Paradise , Unique Eats :flag: The burgers are star of the show, and each seems to be more absurd than the next. Can never go wrong with the classic Kuma's Burger, though. :flag: The Mac and cheese :flag: why wait in a three + hour line for Hot Doug's when Kuma's is right around the corner?! :flag: You're going to get the Mastadon and Mac and cheese.  Then you're going to like this tip. :flag: Can't go wrong with any burger. If you're a first timer, try the Kuma Burger :flag: Everything is amazing! This is Valhalla on earth! My favorite fucking place ever. Whiskey.  On. Tap. :flag: used to be good burgers. good vibe and music, good beer selection. :flag: I still vote Plaguebringer but now they have buffalo patties. Yay! :flag: Kuma Burger, homemade chips, and a 3 Floyd's Zombie Dust: Strong Last Meal contender. :flag: Andrew Zimmerman, chef of Sepia, eats here on his nights off. He loves the Led Zeppelin Burger. :flag: Kuma's corner isn't for dates (unless she has some serious tattoos), and it most certainly isn't for business (unless, you know, you're one of several death metal bands that frequent the place). :flag: The servers here sport more ink than a Bic factory, and the metal is cranked up so loud you can‚Äôt hear yourself talking, but therein lies the charm. :flag: Tribute is paid to the Minotaur, a half-man/half-beast creature, with a 10-ounce beef patty topped with pancetta, caramelized onions and brie. The real focal point, though, is a bourbon-poached pear. :flag: Their mac n' cheese is absolutely ridiculous (in a good way) and any choice of burger is a good call. :flag: Metallica with chicken! The Plague Bringer, Lair of the Minotaur! Slayer (be sure to bring your Tums)! Wash it down with rotating Three Floyd's on tap! #kumascorner #nowafflefries #chicago :flag: Amazing the size of all the burgers... Neurosis was great! Of seven ppl just one ate the fries, its really worth wait. :flag: Come 2 hours before you're hungry. At least half an hour to get a seat and we've been waiting nearly an hour for our burgers.  SLOW KITCHEN. :flag: Everything I thought it would be.... Beyond amazing :flag: Such an amazing place! Great food, good. Music and great drinks! :flag: Huge burgers lol :flag: The scorpion, burger of the month, is ridiculous!! Love is literally oozing from this burger. Fries are ok, and the music is great :) :flag: Such delicious tasting burgers and fun atmosphere :flag: Burger rock music :flag: Food was awesome. Super huge portions. Iron maiden beer on tap. Becky, our waitress was the bomb! :flag: Pantera baby :flag: The Russian Circles burger is awesome! It's only here during March though. :flag: Slayer is not a burger. :flag: Be aggressive when getting a seat at the bar. :flag: Man sagt, dass es hier den besten Burger Chicagos gibt. Meiner war gro√üartig. Sehr laute Heavy-Metal-Musik und sehr voll... aber das muss so! :flag: Lair of the minataur was the best burger I've ever had. Also, the mac n cheese is phenom! :flag: Super amazing yummy fun! :flag: Best burger around. Good craft beer selection. Go now! :flag: Delicious grub, don't skimp on the micro brews or the Mac and cheese. Good for the hang out, date night, or just a chill night for burgers. :flag: Anything u pick is great here!! :flag: Get here early long line but the food is so damn good you won't mine the wait! :flag: It's no surprise that they have The Trooper on tap here. Fried pickles are delicious! :flag: Excellent burgers and enormous portions of build your own Mac n cheese. You won't go hungry. Metal music for some ambience too :) :flag: Led zeppelin burger... Stairway to heaven!!!!! :flag: Get the Mac n cheese! Its so good!! :flag: !,,!'s always playin', they have Whiskey on tap, and they have awesome burgers!,,! :flag: The Pantera burger ... omg :flag: Be prepared for a long wait. Fries are to die for and Iron Maiden burger is delicious. :flag: Amazing burgers and a great beer list! :flag: Amazeballs :flag: GHOST!!! ...you will never regret.... :flag: Should you eat Kuma's unholy Ghost Burger? Here's a helpful checklist to figure it out. :flag: You WILL wait over an hour, maybe hour and a half, and there's no takeout (nor will they seat you before your table is all present), but burgers AND salads are good. :flag: The Famous Kuma Burger is the way to go - amazing pretzel bun with sunny side up egg and bacon. Come hungry because this thing is massive. :flag: They serve burgers here. :flag: Rude staff. Don't come dressed up. Came after a meeting to see friends.They profiled us & wouldn't let us talk w/ friends near their table. When dressed down previously the policy didn't apply. :flag: Try the bbq pork fries! Perfect 4 Two :flag: good mac n cheese, nice burgers, shady movies! :flag: Meat texture, quality and flavor was not good (neither was the 45 min wait after placing our order). Not worth the detour off the interstate unless you really love heavy metal and average burgers. :flag: This is meat heaven!  If you're looking for a veggie option, try out the fried pickles! :flag: Chicago is a meat 'n potatoes town and Kuma's is a bit overrated against the competition. Burgers are no longer hand-formed nowadays to keep up with the demand. Try Bad Apple, Edzo's, or O&E. :flag: Best burger in town? More like best burgers I've had... EVER. Order an extra side of anger and bourbon on tap as well. üëøüëøüëø :flag: Try the Plague Bringer - The Plague Bringer @ Kuma's corner. DELICIOUS! :flag: Perfect as fawk :flag: Best Mac & Cheese ever :flag: Great beer list! A Chicago tradition! :flag: Has a nice patio in the back, if you're not into heavy metal tunes. :flag: Kuma burger all the way. Be sure to get here early or else expect a long wait! :flag: The mac and cheese are to die for. Its a must. :flag: Slayer on top (no bun) Metallica on bottom.  Skip the appetizers for another day on your first visit. :flag: I just had a divine experience: the Mac n cheese with bacon and carmelized onions. You won't be disappointed. :flag: My friend told me that it was the best burger in Chitown. He was right. :flag: mac n cheese > burgers :flag: Get the Pantera Burger! :flag: This place is freaking amazing. I<3 Metal & all of the burgers are named after some of the best bands of all time. Such a rad atmosphere: tattooed employees, LPs, and music. :flag: Be prepared to wait, but it's totally worth it. The Slayer is not to be trifled with. :flag: Vest burgers in town , hands down ! :flag: This is the place if you like gargantuan burgers topped with eggs, bacon, and whatever other salty, fatty ingredients just happens to be lying around. :flag: Ask for the Spencer special (blackened catfish, mashed potatoes, garlic spinach) :flag: Black Sabbath burger :flag: Best burgers in town :flag: Do take into account the long waiting time.. But worth the wait... The staff is friendly and the food is mind-blowing!! :flag: Metallica burger is awesome :flag: Big fat burgers from a popular, insanely loud metal bar, that is divisive in terms of ambience. Former Eater Chicago editor Ari Bendersky says it would be "blasphemous" to leave it off the list. :flag: Only one word can describe this place. Boomshakalaka :flag: The wait is usually long but it's worth it, the mastadoon burger is awesome :flag: Bring a second stomach and a pillow. You will need both. :flag: If you want to bypass the line, go by yourself. :flag: Come hungry. Very hungry. :flag: Get the mac and vheese your way, awesomeness :flag: Meat Sweats Will Happen :flag: This place is best enjoyed on President's Day without RJ Schillaci. :flag: I come here for the flowers on the table and the classical music, and the vegan food. :flag: IMPORTANT: They don't split checks so you need to have cash if you're going in a group (or a good friend to pay for you) ; there's a Chase in Belmont Plaza and BOA across from the Blue Line station :flag: Awesome, per usual!! Thanks for asking :) :flag: The place is ok, there are lots of better places! People just like to go because of the name :flag: ginormous but amazing (& fat!) burgers :flag: One word: Epic! ‚ô• :flag: Get here when they open for shorter wait times :flag: Love the neurosis! :flag: Lair of the Minotaur for President. :flag: Flipping awesome! Well worth the wait! :flag: 22 monster burgers served on pretzel rolls, most named after your scary cousin's favorite rock bands (Slayer, Melvins, Judas Priest). Kuma Burger takes lead guitar. :flag: Not only did they name a burger after the greatest band of all-time, its toppings are exactly what I love on a burger (pulled pork, bacon, cheddar, pickles). Order a Led Zeppelin and a grape soda. :flag: Split the Mac n cheese and a burger! Portions are HUGE! Also, come on a Tuesday at 4pm... Nobody here! :flag: Like it spicy? The "Plague Bringer Burger" has your name all over it: http://chewsy.com/r/a/wgVf8 :flag: The "Lair of the Minotaur Burger" has the distinction of being featured on both "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" as well as "Unique Eats".  Find out why: http://chewsy.com/r/a/Yjw4F :flag: Have the Mac and cheese with prosciutto and caramelized onions. Aad sriracha and its better than ambrosia. :flag: Wednesday night in Chicago.  What can I say? :flag: Still waiting for our burgers. How long does it take to cook a freakin burger? :flag: Drums and riffs will massage your ears, while your eyes feast on epic movies, while the best burgers in the world slay your soul. :flag: Garlic mayo and homemade hot sauce on the Plague Bringer will change how you think about eating a burger. :flag: Yes, the burgers are good, but the mac n cheese is THE business. Wash down with a brew, go home, take a nap. :flag: Probably the best burgers in town. The Mastadon and Metalica are especially delicious :flag: Ask for Chyna. Best waitress there. Tell her Matthew Rivera sent you. ;) :flag: Get the King Bong burger... best burger I've ever had! :flag: Try the Macaroni and Cheese - With corn and jalape√±o. Dinner with @mst3ck & @dawnomatic :flag: Best fricken burger in Chicago! :flag: Not for vegans, but surprisingly... Can be for vegetarians. :flag: Try the The Kuma Burger - Tasted good, really filling, long wait on seating and order :flag: Thought my compadres and I could demolish a few appetizers before our burgers arrived. We were sorely mistaken, and ended up being full after about three bites. Best three bites of my life. :flag: This is the best burger in the country. I love burgers and I've not met Kumas equal. :flag: Bacon and blue cheese fries :flag: Metallica burger. Really good. :flag: Pantera burger is spicy but damn is it good!!!!! :flag: Lunch time :flag: Plentiful portions and consistently good service. :flag: Cheesecakeeee :flag: love their food more than cheesecake. Shrimp taco is yummyüòã :flag: I don't know why it takes them sooooo long to give you a table if most of them are available :flag: Best chicken nuggets ever üòã :flag: Los pasteles riqu√≠simos ,el de godiva üëåüèºun placer para el paladar :flag: Fish Taco is great! :flag: The Fish Taco was great! :flag: Very crowded and very dim light. Try to get a table near to a window. The food and drinks good as always. :flag: C'mon, who doesn't like the Cheesecake Factory. :flag: Hep burada cheesecake yemenin hayalini kurmu≈ütum. Muzlu cheesecake'ini denedim, kesinlikle tavsiye ederim. Ayrƒ±ca yemekler de √ßok lezzetli g√∂r√ºn√ºyordu. Porsiyonlar √ßok b√ºy√ºk.

Their food menu is huge, features food from a multitude of cuisines, and whatever we tasted was freakin' awesome. Good prices :flag: Great place for dinner! Parmesan-herb crusted chicken and grilled salmon were delicious! Love their homemade bread! Loved mashed potatoüòÅ :flag: Fried zucchini!!! :flag: I wish we had an option to test many of the cheesecakes. Unfortunately they don't have this option. We had to eat one single big one. :flag: The Jambalaya tasted like I puked in my mouth. :flag: Muhte≈üem bir restoran kesinlikle gidin :flag: Layout is different from other Factories I've been too. More Gaudi-inspired. This one is below ground but still great food! :flag: ÏùåÏãù Î¨¥ÏßÄÌïòÍ≤å Ïß¨. ÏùåÎ£åÏàò Îçî ÌåîÎ†§Îäî ÏàòÏûëÏù∏ÎìØ.

They may be dirty :flag: Amazing cheesecakes... :flag: Yummy, skip the main course and sample the 30 flavours of cheesecake! :flag: I come for the cheesecake and what is to be said other than EPIC!! :) :flag: Restaurant is looking a little tired. The food is always good at Cheesecake Factory, but this wasn't the best I've had. :flag: I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the employees here don't seem to want any tips. I was sitting for 10 minutes and nobody came to the table to talk to me. Definitely needing more employees. :flag: Oh my gosh. Incredible place! Thousands types of cheesecakes üòç pure love :flag: i got dissapointed..very creamy and heavy cakes:(tastes good but too soft,not the way i like..hated guacamole grilled chckn and buffalo wings..not my kind of tastes,next time will be better i hope.. :flag: Everything is good here! üòã :flag: If they're busy (which they usually are) order a slice of cheesecake to go, and eat it outside on the steps! :flag: Okay. I know it's gross. You haven't been there in years. If you must....order off of the Skinnylicious menu and receive normal size food :flag: This is my go-to when I'm craving bad suburban chain food with an impossible amount of calories per serving. Never fails. :flag: Good portions size and everything delicious :flag: Amazing food. Every time I'm in Chicago, I have to eat there! :flag: Well. It's a Cheesecake Factory alright. Get a seat by the window and watch the wildlife while avoiding any real conversation with the people who brought you to Cheesecake Factory. :flag: Save some space for the dessert!! :flag: CAKES CAKES CAKES :flag: All the menus are so good. Leave some space for cheesecakes! :flag: Be prepared to wait a lot for a table. Otherwise go to the bar and try to find a seat! :flag: Good bathrooms. People seem to appreciate the desserts. :flag: I always get the the Factory Chopped Salad, their dressing is really good! :flag: Make sure to have the sweet potato fries - they're delicious! :flag: Fat, but delicious. Try the bbq burguer. :flag: Great and quite reasonable price and good food and serving :flag: The Service is very bad :flag: Even if you only go for dessert they'll bring a basket of free bread to your table. If you eat all of said bread, be prepared for finishing the cheesecake to be a tasty but stomach-ache-inducing slog. :flag: Me and friend meet up every year and a early dinner at The Cheesecake Factory.   Usually their food was spot on but not today.    Both orders were substandard.  What a letdown! :flag: Portions are so big. Red velvet cheesecake is very tasty. :flag: Excellent recommendation the Chicken Madeira it was great :flag: Big portions. If you enter through Hancock Center, don't expect to be greeted by a host. Instead of eating dessert at your table, opt to buy your cheesecake at the counter. Lowers the bill a bit. :flag: I love this chain, good food, enormous portions and "to die for" cheesecakes. I go there every time I am in the US. :flag: Try their lettuce wrapsüç¥ :flag: Buffalo Blasts.

I have never eaten the cheesecake though. I'm always full when I finish eating. I'm crazy about a steak with asparagus. :flag: Apparently there is a mint-chocolate-chip-cookie-dough cheesecake that you've gotta try :flag: Ask for the Fall's special: Pumpkin cheesecake! Amazing!!! :flag: Don't let then seat you near the kitchen, very loud!!! Delicious food, prices are fair. :flag: Try the SkinnyLicious Turkey & Avocado Sandwich :flag: White chocolate raspberry truff was amazing ... Staff was very kind . :flag: GIANT portions, plan to split everything :flag: Great time there. Meat pasta too much spiced. Still one of the my favorites in US :flag: Food portions are Family sizes, be careful not to order two orders when you are hungry, you an never manages :flag: Eat up top. Less of a wait. Red velvet cheesecake is life changing! :flag: Save room for the cheesecake! :flag: Service is very slow and somehow disorganized. If you decide to order some take away, be ready to wait around a lot.So many employees but they seem to be just standing around, while "looking" busy. :flag: Try the Skinnylicious menu !!  Love the chicken salad sandwich.. Awesome !! :flag: Pasta da Vinci! :flag: Skip the meal and go directly for the cheesecake!!! The portions are huge so there's little room left :-( :flag: Came tonight and last night.

It's a good choice :flag: Ditto on the bar seating. Minimal wait!! :flag: If you like seafood and spicy food get the Jamaican black pepper shrimp :flag: Get the blue cheese BLT burger! And the red velvet cheesecake! They're delicious! :flag: There's something on this menu for every topper of eater. Beware: the small plates are not "small". :flag: Still love the Chinese chicken salad after 20 years! :flag: What makes u think by the time I arrive there won't be a line?! Jeeze it's why I'm calling so u will have it ready! Duh! :flag: Tried 2call 2place an order for cheesecake was put on hold for 20 min till I hung up n called back.

Fresh strawberry cheesecake was our choice 4 the day :flag: Cheesecake, nuff said! :flag: banana cheesecake is to die for! :flag: Baja chicken tacos :-) :flag: get the da vinci pasta :flag: Its the Cheesecake Factory, everything here is good. :flag: Come just before they open at eleven to witness the morning pep cheer! :flag: Once you're seated figure out what you're eating, the night moves faster that way ;) :flag: Great table view :flag: Wouldn't recommend. :flag: Linda's Fudge cake is a must-try! :flag: Must have the avocado rolls......deelish! :flag: Have never ordered anything I didn't like.

I never complain but this waiter's service was terrible. It's not busy. Come on! Other tables with different waiters are getting great service. :flag: Try cheesecake with dulce de leche! :flag: Funky bathrooms :flag: Try the ritz martini. Both Alex and Eric make them pretty well :flag: Try the chicken medeira. :flag: Prepare for enormous sized portions regardless of what you order. :flag: Delicious! Well worth the wait! :flag: The lunch portions are perfect. Salmon is surprisingly delicious :flag: Great service. Before we even realized our food was taking a while (very busy) a manager approached us, explained the "wait," and bought us dessert. I didn't think we waited very long. Raspberry choc. :flag: I agree with sitting at the bar or bar area.. The bartenders are great.. No wait. :flag: Not bad the Mahi Mahi :flag: The lettuce wraps!! Can't go wrong... :flag: SIT IN THE BAR AREA. The table wait was 30 minutes and we literally walked into the bar and sat at a booth. No waiting. :flag: Terrible service! I had such big expectations for this place! I was dying to try the fried mac n cheese balls! Only to be met with a lackluster waitress, a dirty table and dirty utensils! :flag: Strawberry shortcake is to die for :flag: When the waiter brought our beer he said, "Here's your lovely booze." I approve of this. :flag: cheesecake? you mean Nastycake Factory... or Rudecake Factory. or just "Factory" :flag: Love the french fries and glam burgers! :flag: Try 1 of its cocktail with any chicken containing pasta followed by Raspberry Cheesecake....U will get more pleasure than calories ;-) :flag: The strawberry cheesecake is the best! :flag: Steak was good.

Limited menu, but less than half the wait! :flag: Their pasta is awesome and their Guacamole is fantastic! :flag: The lunch salads are very good and very big of course try the yummy cheesecakes! :flag: Get any kind of cheesecake its all good. Get the cuban for a delicious sandwich. :flag: Chicken slider appetizers are terrific. 4 in an order so split them or make it an entree if it's for one. Great deal too 8.95. :flag: They only serve breakfast on Sundays. That's retarded. :flag: Shrimp and bacon club is da bomb!!!! :flag: Great place to walk out after being ignored for ten minutes by bartenders who refuse to make eye contact. :flag: Beers are nothing special, but the food GREAT!I had a deliciously juicy cooked perfectly rare steak with the mushroom sauce and fries.  DELISH! :flag: Bom pra experimentar cervejas locais :flag: In the first 15 minutes nobody came to take the order, despite the restaurant was nearly empty... Burger I had also better.... :flag: Good home  brew. Huge space - great for work group happy hours. Awesome roof top bar patio space. :flag: Love that dark beer. mmmm. :flag: Poor service. Don't expect too much, typical chain restaurant. :flag: Really enjoyed the #PolarBeerFest2017 :flag: Un lugar muy activo y con mucha variedad en cervezas para combinar con la carta del chef :flag: üíïüç®Oh my god!

You'll be glad you did! :flag: The white ale was delicious & the rooftop view is decent. :flag: the bison burger is good :flag: Very good service. :flag: Ask for the USDA Choice ribeye :flag: Rooftop full of people. Good food. Home brewed beer ok. People watching is best. :flag: Staff wasn't very attentive to their customers. After we ordered around 1045 were told they didn't have it since the late night menu started at 11.  Got appetizer AFTER our meal. :flag: Rooftop üëå :flag: Ask for James. He helped us stay dry when we were leaving during a heavy rainstorm. :flag: Waiting for an hour for the rooftop to be opened üò°üò°üò° apparently usually opens at 4pm :flag: Roof top, on point for a casual drink. Especially if you're near the Marriott near by! :flag: Really delicious mac and cheese - you can't go wrong. Also the nachos!!! Holy sh*t they are damn good. :flag: Surprised that a chain restaurant can have such good food. :flag: Your classic chain restaurant. During the spring-fall they have a great rooftop bar, it gets busy pretty quickly. :flag: The bacon chicken Mac and cheese knocked me off my feet in a great way! :flag: –ì—Ä–µ—á–∏ –Ω–µ—Ç, –∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –∞–±—Å–æ–ª—é—Ç–Ω–æ –∑–∞–µ–±–∏—Å—å. –û—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ! :flag: Rock Bottom is always a great pick.

Pairs well with artichoke and crab dip...and likely lots of other appetizers. :flag: If you're looking for something light, the Chicken Waldorf is legit. :flag: Great beers. Good atmosphere. Fun times. :flag: The service was fast and friendly, even when inundated with crowds in town for the Dead shows. Food remains outstanding. :flag: Nice rooftop bar and beer selection- standard bar food. Service was a bit slow. Def get the Mac and cheese though! :flag: Don't order the martini on a Friday night. Incredibly dry and too strong. Couldn't even finish it.  Guacamole and chips are pretty good though. Music sucks. :flag: Their menu at the bar is either different from the restaurant or they changed it and it's not up to date on Foursquare. Also, their late night bar menu is very limited. :flag: They really don't pull the punches on the nachos! :flag: Check out their beer flight- sure to impress! :flag: El Diablo pizza s√≥lo para hombres!! :flag: Rooftop bar is ezcellent :flag: Large venue, more expensive drinks but no complaints about location or food. :flag: The chicken tenders are delish! :flag: Great salmon and burgers.

F--- yes. :flag: Lobster and shrimp enchiladas are out of control good. Try the guacamole, too. It's fresh and very tasty. :flag: El beer sampler, s√∫per recomendado :flag: The back bar area is great for watching a game :flag: PRETZELS!!! :flag: Bartender rocks! From Michigan! Go Wings!  Go lions! Go tigers! :flag: Rock bottom accurately describes their beers, though some beer is better than no beer. Nice roof beer garden though. :flag: Good beer. Good food. Good atmosphere. This is one of the spots we always hit when we're in town. :flag: Try a flight of beers you will be happy with the ride your tatesbuds go on. :flag: Red Ale the best. Rich amber ale with a good hopping flavor. Burgers are the best. :flag: Excelentes cervejas artesanais e ambiente muito agrad√°vel :flag: They do have a nice roof lounge! Nothing spectacular, but just nice! If you are up for a beer go for a  White Ale! It's really mild, not bitter and tasty! :flag: Great food has a rooftop bar love the ice cream sandwich :flag: Food is decent here. Next time I'd sit on the rooftop :flag: Get 'em plain.

Am your waitress. :flag: They can handle large parties with the greatest of ease. Come ready to eat; even their appetizers are suitable meals. :flag: Food was great! Service was awful! :flag: According to Rock Bottom, mayonnaise is considered vegan. Whaaaat? #confused #goodbeerthough :flag: They do not know how to make the burger that you asked for note the way you ask for it to be cooked :flag: Didn't realize it's a gay bar. We visit the one in milwaukee and that one's full of brewpub character. Chi's lacking in that regard but great service :flag: Southwest egg rolls was delicious :flag: No bud lite. They brew everything in house! :flag: A notch below Rock Middle. :flag: Get a flight! It's a good deal and a great way to try the beers. :flag: Chicken nachos are definitely spot on. :flag: Tasty...good employees :flag: Great food... decent IPA... nice waitresses. :flag: The best nachos ever!!!  Try it with chicken :flag: Very tasty fries! Salty though, so they go good with beer. :flag: Go to the Rooftop Patio! :flag: Good food and great beer. :flag: Right now they a prepping to tap their first 2013 Barrel Aged beer. Details were super secret. :flag: Pretty douchey, pop your collars and have the beer sampler. :flag: Service industry gets 40% off the late night menu!! :flag: Baby Ribs & Chipotle salmon are delicious! :flag: Try the Turkey Meatloaf - It was very good and spicy. :flag: Try the Summer Honey Ale - Great taste. :flag: Hendricks cucumber cooler a must! :flag: Mac and cheese is fantastic! Great place to go for a friendly dinner mid-week. Not too crowded, loud music, and a few big screens. :flag: Love this place! The bartenders are not only knowledgable but some of the best bartenders I've come across in chi! :flag: The rooftop is the place to go! :flag: Rooftop deck is great! :flag: Great beer and great steak!  A must visit if you come to Chicago ! :flag: If u go 2 the Rooftop stay Away from  Laren...he/she is the Worst Server..maks a place not wnting 2 come back!! So sad bcuz we tip really well & ths plce can b so amzng!!... He/she needs 2 b gone!!! :flag: Maybe a fluke thing, but this place smells like feet. :flag: Fabulous customer service. Mentioned that my son's steak was a little spicy (after he ate most of it), manager came by and took it off the bill. Very impressed! :flag: I get a half order of brewery nachos and the IPA. :flag: Bacon chicken mac n cheese!!! Oh my!!! :flag: Up on the rooooooooof :flag: If you like a little spice try the its just hot enough medium well. :flag: Steak frites FTW! Seriously - the steak seasoning is amazing. :flag: Rooftop bar is crowded (popular) - not fun for a single whose not trolling.  Food is great, beer outstanding.  Service is good, prices reasonable. :flag: Yummy food and delicious beer ! :flag: The bun on my Laredo burger was phenomenally soft and delicious. I ate and drank so much here, but I can honestly say that I neither went into comatose nor wanted to kill myself for eating so much. :flag: –°—Ç–µ–π–∫ —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä :flag: They should make their items order-able from a smart phone by adding them to the app "appay biz". That way, I can order ahead using "appay"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :flag: The best meat :flag: The Laredo burger is top notch. :flag: Gotta have the Kolsch!! It's a nice light brew easy on the pallet, with a nice kick! :flag: If you like tequila, the southwest lemonade is a must. :flag: Burgers are awesome. Perfect place to go hang out after work. :flag: Laredo Burger and the White Ale make a great lunch. :flag: Delicious pulled pork sandwich and the wait staff is so friendly! :flag: The 2 A.M. Has hash browns, egg, bacon, and cheese. :flag: Really good food. Burgers are too die for. :flag: Haley was amazing! Quivk service. Join the Mug Club. :flag: Great food n biers! :flag: Try the Pineapple Double IPA. Bad Ass! :flag: The brewery nachos with some beer. What a perfect combination. So many great appetizers! :flag: Try the pineapple ipa :flag: Try the white ale! :flag: Absolutely fantastic, the Creole Jambalaya was brilliant! :flag: Always ask to sample the new brew on tap...it's normally pretty good. The Winter Tartan Scottish Ale was great. :flag: I love this place because of the cheap beer and afterwards you can literally fall into the subway. :flag: Mug Club gets you more beer for your buck! Beer tastings are a must! Gray place to watch multiple sports games...plenty of flat screens :flag: The blackened shrimp MacNcheese is heavenly. :flag: Nice place 2 go 2!!!! :flag: The Terminal Stout is magically delicious. :flag: Rooftop bar is a must! :flag: Great food and beer bar right near the waterfront. Tons of space and TVs. Try the freshly brewed beer! :flag: Liked the shrimp and lobster tacos, didn't like the rice and beans side. Would recommend subbing for the chips! :flag: Try the salt! :flag: Nachos were great, drinks were alright, servers were rude. We had two different people one on the roof and one in the dining room and both were pretty rude. :flag: Between the games on the TV and the Pool tables this place is great for a night out, and because they serve food all night they don't card at the door. You still have to be 21 to drink though ;) :flag: I had the 2a Burger here an it is one of the best burgers I've ever had! :flag: Try the Cajun Fish Tacos - Great dish :flag: Rooftop!,,,,,strung lights, good brew, great friends....love. This chi-town spot! Get there early or have good seat mojo:) :flag: Neophytes like to gripe that this place isn't as good since Pete Crowley left (for Haymarket). There's no satisfying some twits. Seasonals are solid. Stick to them. Food is OK. ‚òû Free wi-fi. :flag: I feel like I am at home at a Colorado brewery here. :flag: Shrimp and Lobster tacos are awesome here. :flag: Belgian White Ale was quite tasty. :flag: Be sure to wash your hands after using the bathroom. :flag: Bathrooms upstairs, do middle stalls :flag: Free wifi - password is RBChicago :flag: Horrible service!!!! :flag: "alt Capone" == awesome.  Get Baseball Speed app too http://bballspeed.com/app :flag: Frostbite or bust. :flag: Try the Hickory BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger - I thought the burger was excellent. Had to add some avocado to make it healthier, but it was excellent. Would definitely order it again. :flag: The rock bottom beers suck. But they have miller lite in bottles! :flag: Rock Bottom is right. If you're here you have hit rock bottom. Waitstaff is miserable and hamburger are worse  You'd be better off to go across the street and by a box of cereal from Jewel. :flag: The chicken enchaladas are on thse small siide but the chicago gold brew makes up for them. :flag: Get the soft pretzels as an appetizer and a burger for your meal. Best things on the menu! :flag: Good family resturant. :flag: They have really good nachos for an appetizer! :flag: Good food but the service is consistently slow and unattentive. :flag: Join the mug club for a few free ounces on every pour. :flag: Red Ale & Margarita Pizza!!! Don't miss out, Summer is almost over!!! :flag: Mug Club is for losers. :flag: The rooftop patio is the ideal spot for a summer afternoon.The views aren't bad at night either. :flag: Don't get the cask ale unless you have hair on your chest. Definitely resembles a scotch. :flag: roof nice as far as roofs go :flag: Goto the rooftop bar for a nice breeze and some beautiful ladies.. :flag: The rooftop makes for a fun happy hour. :flag: Specialty dark is really good!! Great price too! :flag: The Summer Blonde was amazing.. As was the White Ale :flag: Shrimp and Lobster tacos are the BEST :flag: Roof bar closes early :( IPA delicious tho! :flag: Chicken Fried Chicken is da bomb! :flag: Try the asian ahi salad! Sooo fresh! :flag: Welcome to my hood. If it's nice out, make your way up to the rooftop deck. :flag: The food and beer at this chain in mediocre at best :flag: This place is a joke and I am never going back...a few of the workers were so rude. UGH! :flag: Polar Beer Festival - a new twist on the typical beer tasting by offering a delicious selection of more than 15 strong winter ales & serving them outside on a rooftop party deck in the middle of Feb. :flag: Try the 2am burger! It's really good. Also make sure you get the kettle chips as you're side. They are fantastic! :flag: Try the green chili fried mac and cheese and chicken lettuce wraps!  Frostbite beer is top notch! :flag: The Mac N' Chicken is delicious, especially on a cold, winter day. :flag: The deep fried mac n cheese app? Omg I can die happy now :-) :flag: try the smoked helles...amazing hints of bacon. Titan toothpicks go great with it :flag: Happy Hour 3 - 6 PM. $5 for any appetizer! Try the Titan Toothpicks. :flag: If you like dark beers, you'll love the stout made/served here. Delish! :flag: 2AM BURGERS :flag: If you're heading to the rooftop, grab a beer from the main bar first cause they have the full selection. Make sure to ask for it in a plastic cup though. :flag: try the mac and cheese appetizer :flag: 99% sure that the Construction beer special of the day is literally any beer the bartender feels like saying, as he told me Eric the Red and the people next to us Chicago Gold.  That's cool with me, j :flag: Just a drunken stumble from the Grand Red Line station, this sporty brewpub offers six house-brewed beers to sip on. :flag: Double cheeseburger with everything fresh onions and avocado üëçüèª :flag: This place rocks! Epic is the word! More so because it's 100% Halal! Rock on! :flag: Like the Chipotle of burgers, it's quick, easy, and quite tasty! Their turkey burger and sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious. A bit expensive for burgers, but worth the occasional splurge. :flag: Fast service. Good burger. This is the original location... :flag: Wheat bun, beef, aged cheddar, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickle, mayo, and regular fries with a side of ranch for dipping. :flag: Get a bottle of Coke with your burger. :flag: SO good- get the BBQ bacon cheeseburger! :flag: Grear chicken burger with horseradish cheese. You can pick your favorite ingredients and have it at your way! Nice quick bite :flag: Amazing burger! :flag: Probably the best fries I have ever tasted :flag: Can't go wrong with a shake! :flag: This Epic Burger location was one of the 1st in the city servicing the loop college crowd, but it needs a refresh / remodeling. :flag: Huge, huge burgers :flag: There was nothing epic about my burger at this location! Once the bun top was taken off of my sons burger meat was coming apart (crumbles) for the price you pay I expect "Epic" and tasteful! :flag: Try the turkey burger with bacon and a fried egg! :flag: Burger. Cheese burger. Add an egg. :flag: Turkey burger :flag: grab a window seat if you like people watching :flag: Turkey & beef burgers. Try em both. :flag: Cheeseburger with fried egg! :flag: Excelente hamburger americano, vale a pena!!! :flag: Rico y barato :) :flag: One of the few chains you can get havarti cheese for your burger!

Only felt half way guilty about this burger & fry combo! :flag: Having a greasy burger before I really party! :flag: Epic Jr., with havarti cheese, grilled onions and avocado!  Get it now! :flag: Great fast food burger. :flag: Merlin Verrier, chef of Graham Elliot, eats here on his nights off. He loves the Turkey burger. :flag: My burger and PB milkshake were so yummy!! =p =p love it! :flag: It was ok, nothing special. I could have gotten a better burger in nice joint for the price of this psdo fast food joint. :flag: I have never had a burger this good in my entire lifetime of thirty years.  Classic turkey.  His name was chet.  Home grown and fed right until plump enough to become my meal.  Thanks epic. :flag: They have 1! Burger selection,  I ordered a portbello hamburger and it was just a big mushroom without meat!!!! Horrible experience!!! :flag: Stellar stuff! The way a burger should be! :flag: Burger was dry and fries were too oily. Overrated. :flag: I complained about the nudity in the TV set and the blood and violence. Manager told me there were no kids and that nipples showing on a woman during intercourse was acceptable. #so-upset :flag: Pull out your camera and the staff will attack you. So horrible. Absolutely disappointed. Made me feel like an idiot for finding the place neat enough to share. Won't be back. Recommend coworkers skip :flag: Get the Epic Burger! It is epic! :flag: Not worth the price. :flag: I love burgers. But I REALLY love EPIC BURGER. Don't forget the special sauce your taste buds will thank you. :flag: I just wanted to add that you can have your egg over-easy or fried. My previous comment about eggs being too done seems to be applicable here and the Rush Street location. :flag: The turkey burger is good and not horribly dry. You can add an egg, but I've found that when I ask for runny, it's still pretty cooked. Maybe opt for cheese or epic sauce instead. :flag: Go #Hercules @theepicburger w/a classic double; bacon, egg, cheese + all toppings. Raspberry Tea, PB milkshake. #thashicray :flag: Check in to Foursquare and unlock free fries deal! :flag: The turkey burger is amazing! The ingredients seem very fresh and the thing tastes awesome. French fries are excellent as well. Highly recommended. :flag: Mushroom Portobello burger is delicious! Good option if you're vegetarian...not sure if it's the best vegan option. :flag: They now open at 10:30!!! :) :flag: Wifi is down as of 12/6/2012. :flag: Don't eat at Epic Burger! Plastic packaging came out of my burger and they did nothing about it other than throwing the evidence to garbage! Well done... I am still feeling like throwing up. :flag: This place certainly lives up to its name. :flag: Always cold in the restaurant...winter, spring, summer and fall. Bring a sweater. :flag: eh! its not all that.... :flag: The portabella mushroom sandwich is out of this world!!! :flag: Try the four berry smoothie. :flag: Chain doesn‚Äôt signify commoditized mass culture when the business in question uses cage-free eggs, slices its own fries and serves crispy patties of humanely raised, hormone- and antibiotic-free meats :flag: Chocolate milkshake, nuff said :flag: grilled onion + 1yr aged cheddar fosho! :flag: Epic sauce can normally be found on a McDonald's Big Mac!! :flag: Slathered on a bun with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and thick slices of bacon, the sauce takes what would be a serviceable breakfast sandwich and turns it into a decadent morning essential. :flag: Get an egg on that burger!  Do it, do it now! :flag: Ask them to make you a peanut butter chocolate milkshake. Heavenly! :flag: Ask them make you a peanut butter chocolate milk shake. Seriously heavenly. :flag: Juicy, crispy-edged patties (available in junior size) and crisp, skin-on fries are reason enough to head to any of Epic's outposts. :flag: Get your burger with havarti and bacon...good fries, student discounts. Excellent. :flag: Burgers are cooked to a nice medium. Opt for aged cheddar, bacon and egg toppings, and be sure to add the rustic, skin-on fries.

Opt for aged cheddar, bacon and egg toppings, and be sure to add the rustic, skin-on fries.

OH WAIT YOU CAN'T, GET IN MY MOUTH. :flag: Chicago-based burger chain focusing on natural ingredients. Solid, shake-shack style burgers. Would love to see this chain expand beyond downtown chicago. A treat each time we visit. :flag: Portabella sandwich is amazing! Love it with some fries and a peanut butter shake! Nom Nom Nom! :flag: Best "healty" burgers in town! :flag: Good for free wi-fi. :flag: Great chicken burger, tasty fries and fast service. Definitely worth checking out if you find yourself in the area. :flag: The Milk & Honey shake is fantastic! :flag: Real epic ones! im a burgers big fan and i will never forget EPIC BURGERS. Too bad they are only in the best city of the world. Also, there is a screen with tweetdeck showings tweets from customers :flag: Epic burger is ... epic. Top-notch burger all around; great sauce! :flag: YUMMY AT Epic Burger! :flag: I found my moms homemade, hand cut fries here. There's nothing like it. :flag: Dont miss the horseradish havarti on your burger. :flag: Good food but after the last experience will probably not eat here again. Ever. :flag: They also have whole wheat burger buns :) :flag: I LOVE EPIC BURGER. I always get the junior turkey burger w/cheddar. So good. And the smoothies are fro-yo + skim milk based. The milk and honey one's amazing, and the PB one too! :flag: Try the epic BLT, its delicious and has a fried egg on top, so consider it extra delicious :) :flag: PB Enjoy (ask for it with blueberries) :flag: Ask for extra Epic Sauce, they usually give it to you in a little cup. It makes the fries so much better :flag: Free wi-fi :flag: For all the vegetarians out there, try the portabella mushroom sandwich. It is dope. :flag: Expect handcrafted burgers & natural ingredients expertly assembled by chef David Friedman‚Äôs staff, as well as the initial crowds of beef-starved foodies. Grand opening coming up on June 1. :flag: Holy deliciousness. Awesome organic burgers and greasy fair fries. They also have a flat screen displaying all epic burger tagged tweets in real time - pretty cool. :flag: Eat here, its good! :flag: Great free range burgers and yummy fries. However, don't let the brownies on the counter fool you - they are no good. :flag: take jimmy g to lunch here. :flag: Bacon or fried egg on a burger. Why not both? :flag: Although it's not a burger, I highly recommend the chicken sandwich.  And opt for Havarti! :flag: Go next door to 7-11 to buy any non- pepsi products. All they have is pepsi. :flag: Go to Epic Burger and get the fries! Pick up a turkey burger while you're at it! YUMMM! :flag: What don't you want on your salad? They don't have that here. :flag: Best salad bar in the loop! :flag: Amazing salad bar! :flag: Amazing salad bar selection with a variety of pastas, veggies, breads, and wraps.

Make sure to eat before you get here if you want good food. :flag: Lay over at ORD gives me goosebumps! Hectic... :flag: Quickly in and quickly out. Pre-check line is usually fine and the options airside are plentiful in terms of food and drink. :flag: I try to avoid this airport at all costs if possible, can never make my connection having to walk and haul myself a mile it seems to another gate! :flag: Lots of great shops here to grab a bite!            #mri-experts                        Http://www.mrioptimize.com :flag: Oft delayed (weather), poor food options and there's like 2 outlets in the entire place.

It‚Äôs beautiful! :flag: Good selection of places to hang out if ur stuck :flag: Plenty of places to eat,  plenty of charging ports. :flag: Why is this place so cold inside. :flag: Concourse B, United has barely any seating. :flag: üíúHonoluluüå∏Kahuluiüå∫ :flag: Bathrooms...Delta Terminal...the shitters here have automatic plastic wrappings! Fancy. :flag: Effective check-in, hallways not very relaxed though :flag: There are some really pretty things in this airport and some not so pretty things.  Also the bathrooms are weird. :flag: Great selection of restaurants and shopping. Had a long layover here - the only negative was the difficulty in figuring out how their letter/number system for their gates works...I still don‚Äôt know. :flag: The Cubs bar is a great place to hang out while waiting for a flight.

Highly recommend as well as Tortas Frontera for food, as this airport overall has poor food selections. Garrets popcorn is great for snacking! :flag: Busy airport :flag: Nice people. Surprisingly awesome salmon at, wait for it, TGI Fridays. :flag: Main terminal had sucky opts for places to eat.

While still laid out a little strange, it's interior still holds up. :flag: I had a 3 hour layover and got stuck in the smallest terminal. I would have had to go back through security to visit the other terminals and risk getting delayed. What a stupid architectural decision. :flag: Be sure to walk around and enjoy the artsy displays throughout the airport! We got pretty good hot dogs (not Chicago dogs) from the Billy goat at a decent price :flag: Very clean great food court t3 :flag: They don't allow Ubers to pick you up at arrivals, only at select departure terminals (the small area between departure terminal 2 & 3). :flag: Good service.

However O'Hare is notorious for delays. Beware of bad weather and the overbooked air traffic problems. :flag: Pretty awesome airport. It also has a green area and a yoga room. Very nicely decorated too! :flag: Park in the G remote lot :flag: Why do you need premier access at the beginning if finally you stuck in common line anyway? :flag: One of the most travelled through airports in the country. Very cool stuff. :flag: Uber out of airport best way to beat traffic :flag: Pretty nice airport. :flag: Beautiful airport. Terminal 1 is very busy with United traffic, so go to Terminal 2 if you have time for food and drinks! :flag: Beautiful and modern. Loved it :flag: Incredible airport. :flag: Up to date and clean :flag: Worst Wi-Fi of any airport ever. Free Wi-Fi disconnects randomly. Paid Wi-Fi stays connected.

Plenty of neutral experiences and quite a few bad ones, but never anything to recommend it. :flag: Aeroporto enorme, com bom entendimento de suas √°reas :flag: Big and confusing but that's ok. :flag: Descubra seu port√£o e corre pra n√£o perder seu v√¥o..

They have plenty to eat or places to shop. :flag: Flights are always delayed or late. Facilities could be a bit cleaner :flag: Terrible food options. Security lines can be long. :flag: quite big, long time walking for transit :flag: Wicker Park Sushi is hands down the best eat at ORD üç£üç∏ :flag: Broken stalls in most of the bathrooms in concourse C. Pretty much a third world airport, avoid if possible :flag: Reliable airport with tons to do and easy to navigate across :flag: Tons of restaurants to choose from b :flag: Together with Frankfurt some of the least pleasant airports in the world. TSA Pre and Global Entry are effectively required to have a somewhat humane experience most days. :flag: The free wifi only lasts for 30 mins so be careful if you need to call uber :flag: Good airport. :flag: Le hacen las tiendas afuera en el area de llegadas, uno no se siente bienvenido rodeado de paredes grises. :flag: Macaroni Grill by gates H and K serves a great breakfast. :flag: Security has been super tough lately.

Also, they have fruitopia on the drink machine which I was amped about lol :flag: Follette did rub usury nun :flag: Best one I ever seen :flag: What a JOKE .......  1) got a McChicken sandwich with only 1/2 a bun, 2) got home and all eight (8) of the Grilled Onion Cheddar sandwiches each had less than a teaspoon of grilled onions if lucky. :flag: Mmmm, Value Menu. Buy one Big Mac, get one free! :flag: Just because the sign says they open at 5 doesn't man they will be open. :flag: Homeless dudes will circle you like vultures, and don't forget Gary "do you leik oatmeal?"

My burger was missing they took my smoothie off my order then i asked for no ice n it was loaded :flag: They suck......make sure you check your order before driving off :flag: The gospel music playing doesn't make this location any less ghetto or sketchy :flag: I asked for Chicken sandwich, I got a Bacon Angus burger. I asked for a Sprite, I got a Coke. :flag: Worse mcdonalds ever. Orders are 100% guaranteed to be wrong. Godspeed. Dont touch anything in the.store.  Its homeless bum headquarters. :flag: Don't ever go this Mcdonalds in a hurry. They're slow, and your order will be wrong. If you're looking for crack though, they got you! Hahaha. :flag: 10mins waiting stuck behind a car and 5 mins at the window only for the lady to have my order wrong and my food cold. This is the second time my food was cold.

Far from fast...yesterday I waited over 20 minutes for soggy cold food. :flag: If you've never heard of the McGangBang, it's a McChicken stuck inside a McDouble. :flag: Service can be bad when they are really busy.

It's in a skeezy neighborhood and skeezy types do come in, but I've never had much trouble here. It's far from the hellhole everyone else is making it out to be. :flag: No way without a Kevlar vest. :flag: Way too many ghetto people. Get in and get out ASAP or they start asking for money. :flag: Seriously go thru the drive thru, don't bother going inside :flag: Extra charge for extra anything :flag: stick around to watch some of the worst humanity has to offer. :flag: They've got a security guy today... Keepin it locked down.  My Big Mac is great. :flag: Ghetto much! Beware of the homeless crowd lurking around :flag: Not the greatest mcdonalds. Best for take out. :flag: The sign says 12 am breakfast.  But that's only for weekdays. Fri-Sun they don't serve breakfast at 12am :flag: The people who work here are basically saints. Line moves fast, even with the Wrigleyville crowds. :flag: The inside is 24/7 just like the outside! For that, I say "life is good!" :flag: I love Big Macs. :flag: These idiots need to cook their fries right. :flag: McCaf√© FTW... :flag: Cheapest food item on the menu is small fries... At $1.30. :flag: No more Dollar Menu here. :flag: Ok I guess :flag: Their hot fudge sundae seems a bit skimpy compare to other McDonalds. :flag: Best post-Metro/Music Box Theatre. :flag: McChicken FTW :flag: Very crowded, but they are nice.. Took 7 minutes for a meal of 2 buritto.  Still better than the skyway mickyd's :flag: They have a very strict policy that you MUST finish your food in thirty minutes. We've been kicked out by the timekeeper before. He'll be the only one in a White Sox Jersey. :flag: Why does it always take 4 hours to get food at 3am? Its the same crappy quality stuff no matter what time it is. :flag: Slowest ever. :flag: Try a McCafe Cherry Berry Chiller on a hot day :) :flag: Taco Bell across the street is better :flag: Try their fries! :flag: Saw Ronnie woohoo here before the game getting some ice cream(: :flag: The sweet n sour sauce is now made without eggs! score! :flag: When they close the dining room you can always order from the drunk window inside the first door. :flag: The bathrooms are nasty a lot of the time. :flag: BBQ sauce in dispensers next to ketchup! Amazing! :flag: Just got a quarter pounder and I squeezed the bun like the dude in the avatar commercial :flag: Don't think you're smart and try to park in this lot for free, and sneak over to the Cubs game across the street.  You'll figure you out and you'll get towed. :flag: Wide array of great clothes.... :flag: Cartoon network is always on the TV... This is good about half the time. :flag: Try the Big Mac meal! :flag: Worst customer service ever. But the fries are addicting. :0/ :flag: They need to work on their scheduling - there are always a lack of workers during peak times. Also, they should update that order guide because they're always out of something! :flag: This is a very nice McDonald's. However, they have a terrible music selection. :flag: They've completely rebuilt this place from the ground up, so it is quite swanky inside (for a McDs). Very modern furniture and looks like a decent place to sit down and meet a friend. :flag: I love da new mc d :flag: The new place looks awesome and the manager Gaby is super awesome! :flag: Closed until December:( :flag: Dont bother eating here unless you beyond starving. Horrible service! Messed up my.order three times even after repeating it to me. :flag: Epic slowness :flag: Always check your order! Lots of errors but they do fix them without hassle. :flag: Slow service inside, slow service at the drive thru... Just slow :flag: Most god awful service ever. Gotta stop being poor and fat. :flag: Don't roll up on a bike any more! :flag: Quite possibly one of the most ghetto McDonald's in the city...but the staff tries! :flag: Slowest service EVER. :flag: The vanilla cones are amazing.

Not your average McDonalds. My friend and I just stopped in when we were in the area walking by :flag: The second Mcdonalds in the world? Free coffee! :flag: This is the place Wesley Willis sang about. Great mini-museum upstairs of McD's history. :flag: MC donalds nice  view from the top floor :flag: Para mi el mejor #McDonalds el primer mcdonalds que se hizo esta en #DesPlainesill pero era s√≥lo una barra a donde llegabas a comprar hamburguesas, se supone que este es el primer restaurant !! :flag: .49 cent vanilla ice cream cones! :flag: Upstairs is where it's at.  A simple bakery on the second floor, along with couches and nice view. :flag: Will never spend another dime here. :flag: Amazing staff...terrible coffee. :flag: The biggest. :flag: Awesome if you are hung over! :flag: Best Rock n' roll Mc Donald's. :flag: Chic lounge area upstairs and cafe here.  Nice tourist attraction. Parking validation. :flag: Like the new chicken wings and the Buffalo sauce. :flag: great place to stop in for a milkshake before comedy show :flag: Like this is you scored a free soda off someone you happened to talk to in line :flag: It's very clean in here. Something u normally don't see anymore :flag: Go up stairs and visit its museum !! :flag: Strawberry creame cheese pie is the best! :flag: Try the Big Mac :flag: Order a McGangBang burger, a McChicken in the middle of a double cheeseburger. :flag: 5minutes to get waited on when there was no line and the manager just ignored me while he stood around talking. #theworst. :flag: One of the biggest McDonald ever. :flag: Gets your order wrong, 4/7 times I've been here. I asked for a hamburger only ketchup. Is it that hard to understand? :flag: Get yourself upstairs, listen to the tunes, and try and forget you're at a McDonald's. :flag: Everything is overly expensive for a McD's. I'd check out their specials, though. New food, like the chicken wraps, are promoted and cheaper! :flag: New spicy chicken mc bites, little limited time :flag: 2.14 for a freaking large drink? Lame :flag: Come here for the free wi-fi, clean bathrooms, and to quietly sing the Wesley Willis song as you check out the memorabilia on the upper level. Do not, however, come here to eat. :flag: Expensive as hell. Better offgoing to Portillos across the street.  3.55 for a sausage mcmuffin.  No dollar menu. :flag: If Lawrence is around, let him do your portrait, $5 per person! :flag: 24 hours baby! :flag: A nice drive through considering the location :flag: Best McDonalds in the city. Always has the hottest fries and orders are accurate 99.9% of the time. :flag: This is the place the late Chicagoan Wesley Willis was singing about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWWsWP9bPAg :flag: I Love their icecream! :flag: They have a pop culture history display on the second floor which covers the following decades: '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, & 90s. :flag: For a snack, try a Crispy Chicken Ranch Wrap. :flag: For a snack, try a McDouble off of the Dollar Menu. :flag: For a treat, try a Vanilla Cone! :flag: For a treat, try an Oreo McFlurry! :flag: Try the Sweetened Iced Tea. :flag: For breakfast, try the Hotcakes. :flag: Be sure to check out the upstairs sections, they have 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's sections with the music playing from said time frames! :flag: Numca enjoarei desse fast-food :flag: Check out the rock & roll memorabelia :flag: Parking in the lot is free (validated with $10 purchase) :flag: Make sure your order is over $10. You get a hour of free parking. :flag: they do not offer free medium fries... :( :flag: The manager does not honor the foursquare special. It's unbelievable!! :flag: They refuse the check in coupon!! Beware!! :flag: Don't use the coupon they all don't speak english and don't know about the coupon!! :flag: Mcdonalds does not redeem foursquare promotions!!! Even the manager had no idea but we should have got a free chicken sandwich with purchase!!! :flag: Venus the mgr wouldn't honor the check-in offer AND the frys sucked! Avoid! :flag: They don't honor the check in special (buy any snack wrap, get one free)...LAME!!! :flag: No free refills! :flag: It might be a Maccies, but god damnit at 1am, it's all cooked fresh. Bloody great. :flag: McDonalds is the place to rock, It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat, It is a good place to listen to the music, People flock here to get down to the rock music :flag: Really clean and their quick :flag: Nice lounge.. this is the mother of all mcDonalds :flag: Disgusting. Why are you here? I cant imagine anything worse. :flag: Get some food :flag: There's 2 floors... WTF?? :flag: Great shit stool. :flag: This rock 'n' roll-themed branch of McDonald's (a 2011 Most Innovative Company) draws massive crowds: Its capacity is 300 people, more than three times as many as the average McDonald's. :flag: try and ride the escalator UP! :flag: I like the restaurant but they need some type of management or security to keep the crazy's at bay! :flag: Gelato upstairs! It's very good! :flag: NO value meal. ur better off going to a REAL restaurant!!! #thismcdonaldsSUCKS!!! :flag: WORST McDonalds to come to!!! People will cut u UNMERCIFULLY!!! Ur better off starving!!! #NoJoke :flag: WORST McDonalds to come to!!! People will cut in line me :flag: Rock n Roll mcdonalds :flag: Perfect for a family parking spot. Centrally located to many points, clean bathrooms, good changing location for the young ones and plenty of table space to feed the kids. Wagons are welcome! :flag: Comfy lounge style seating and coffee bar upstairs :flag: Should not be refered to as the rock n roll McDonalds anymore. It hasn't been RnR for years. Now it's just the one that costs way more than the one 3 blocks away. :flag: Free Wi-Fi :flag: Too expensive! But it's a landmark... :flag: Open 24hrs! Except has no $1 menu. :flag: Ask for Candace she is the Specialist for Men's Polo Big and Tall. :flag: Such nice ppl and great food :flag: Lori is super nice and friendly. Recommend this place for friendly service and good food. :flag: Gotta try the ham delight...wow is that good! :flag: try the Bacon Chive cream cheese it's the BEST! :flag: Amazing breakfast sandwiches...my favorite is the Bacon egg and cheese... :flag: Need to get a bite fast at a drive-thru but want to control fat and calories? Get a Veggie Eggwhite Flatbread Sandwich here and an unsweetened iced tea. Much better choice than a Big Mac. :flag: The Chicken Avocado BLT is a great lunch choice. :flag: The salad with tuna was basic, as expected, but good! Fresh ingredients, not too much mayo, good size, and good to go containers which is important to me. I will order from there again! :flag: Chicken cutlet is the best :flag: Best cutlets everrrrr :flag: Best chicken cutlet anywhere....period :flag: This is the best makeup team in the mall! Best makeup on the market and great prices. They are so humble and talented and just incredible people! Visit them... You will NOT be disappointed! :flag: Happy fourth of July! :flag: Best place in the world :flag: The water seems really nice today in this scorcher of a heat wave. :flag: A truly delicious burger, juicy and flavoursome. A small cosy restaurant with character, which is always packed, but well worth the wait. :flag: Venimooo is a must and the Mac and cheese. Best burger I had in London :flag: Lunchtime and dinner. The service and food are fantastic.  Venison burger and the steak. More than anything, the haggis Mac and cheese! :flag: Burger, Haggis pops :flag: Scotch egg a must really tasty dish and the Venison "deer" tartare was so good we had to order another, fish bites are delicious perfect tartar sauce , super friendly staff highly recommend :flag: smug / rude waiters :flag: Veni-Moo Burger üçî with Bacon ü•ì is a MUST! Pass on the Minced Venison appetizer, the beer sticks are good n spicy jerky. :flag: The set up of the door is a bit awkward - the food is good with loads of flavour only wish that it was warmer :flag: Hate to go against the grain but the Mac and cheese wasn't really that great. Sorry but it was rather dry. The veni-moo was good though! :flag: –ê—Ç–º–æ—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω–æ, —Å—Ç–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ –∏ –≤–∫—É—Å–Ω–æ. –ü–æ–ø—Ä–±—É–π—Ç–µ –¢–∞—Ä—Ç–∞—Ä –∏–∑ –æ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω—ã –∏ scotch egg. –°—Ç–µ–π–∫ –∏–∑ –æ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω—ã —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–µ–Ω, –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ü–µ–Ω–∞-–∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –ö –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–π –ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –ø–æ–¥–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω whiskey shot. –ü–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä—É—é –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è :flag: Abundant but not too special. :flag: To die for mac & cheese üßÄ And one of the best venison steaks I've ever had for only ¬£13 (chips included). Also highly recommend the haggis pops. Basically order everything! :flag: For the carnivore in you. Voted one of the best burgers in London and lives up to it. Love the shotgun as a door handle. :flag: Think burger. Think whisky. Think red wine. You get the picture. And it's friendly and comfortable. :flag: Book ahead! :flag: Take the burger and ask for ketchup and mayo! You'll need a side dish to get full. One of the best burgers in London!! :flag: Great service, very tasty food! Mushrooms with truffle and egg for starter! And their main burger. Great dinner and cosy place :flag: Food very poor - ambience utterly warm & cosy. :flag: Veni Moo burger was great. Would not recommend the Haggis Mac & Cheese at all - really dry, barely any cheese at all. :flag: Burgers are good. Beer is a bit expensive... and pretentious attitude :flag: Haggis pops come with the most addictive sauce ever. The Veni-Moo is your obligation. The haggis mac'n cheese is the best I've ever had in London. üîäüîâüîäDO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT HAVING THE MAC'N CHEESE. :flag: You've gotta love meat to come here. Even the green beans are served with black pudding :flag: As a side, don't over look the green beans with black pudding which were cooked to perfection and a perfect pair! :flag: Have the Veni-Mac burger. :flag: I had venison, done to medium. Tender & juicy, a tad chewy. Along with the bearnaise, my server recommended a red sauce that wasn't on the menu; great with the venison. Gets crowded even during lunch. :flag: I've tried fish bites and it was delicious I liked the tartar üëåüèº The burger was absolutely the best in London so juicy and tender venison steak was tender and melts in your mouth service was great. :flag: Scotch. Venison. Haggis Mac & Cheese. :flag: Steaks to die for. Don't leave without trying a dram of whisky. :flag: Burger was really good :flag: Great atmosphere, nice staff, delicious food. Will definitely go back :flag: The best burger in town! :flag: We waited over an hour for steaks, and the restaurant was really loud. I think there must be a design flaw. Measuring with our phone shows that it was nearly 90 decibel!! Food was fine though. :flag: Great beef and venison steak. Tasty mash potato and haggis. :flag: Voo burger is amazing and also Haggis balls!! :flag: Have the teacakes for dessert - delicious :flag: The burger is described as the "best in London" - we could argue about that, but only whether or not it really is the absolute best, or merely one of the top three... Either way, it's really excellent :flag: If you like venison and/beef, and great beer, you will like this restaurant! The staff are excellent, the ambience is great, the location central. My venison steak frites was perfect! :flag: Amazing steak! And turnip like you've never had before (it's mostly butter, in a good way) :flag: You can't miss it. :flag: Still construction.... :flag: ŸÖÿ™ŸàŸÇŸÅŸá ŸÑŸÑÿµŸäÿßŸÜÿ© :flag: Big ben yakƒ±ndan g√∂rmek üëçüèº :flag: ÿÆÿ≥ÿßÿ±Ÿá ŸàŸÇÿ™ ŸÖÿßÿ¨Ÿäÿ™ ŸÉÿßŸÜ ŸÅŸä ÿßÿπŸÖÿßŸÑ ÿµŸäÿßŸÜŸá üò´ :flag: Leider wird der Big Ben restauriert!!! :flag: Big Ben is currently under construction :flag: Est√° em reforma. :flag: Nisan 2018 Big ben de tadilat vardƒ± ≈üans bir≈üey g√∂remedik :flag: Est√° en reparaci√≥n por 4/5 a√±os. :flag: Punto importante para visitar Londres.

Thanks Ben! :flag: Try to keep away from it on the eve of 5th of November if you aren't into fights with the police. :flag: Great Thursday deal, lobster and steak both delicious, grand sharing platter was amazing. High quality customer service despite the restaurant being busy staff found a table for us & was very friendly :flag: Amazing ribs :flag: The food was okay, the service was also okay however the food served us was delayed and it‚Äôs just really annoying to wait for nothing for about an hourrrrrr! ‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏Å!!!! üòî :flag: Food is decent but a bit pricey. Had a craving for wings. Only served as appetizer. Maybe six small wings. At 9 pounds a bit pricey. Tasted good. :flag: Service is great. So is the meat. Try the Taste-O-Rama :flag: The food was great and so was the service. :flag: The steamed lobster is better than Burger&Lobster's.. but the lobster roll is not. Try the Lobster mac & cheese üëåüèºüòã :flag: Bottomless brunch: ¬£29.5 for unlimited BBQ and bottomless house brew, prosecco or wine. :flag: Ask for the garlic & butter sauce with your lobster. It is so tasty! :flag: Lobster lovers, DON'T COME HERE. Go Burger&Lobster instead! We waited for a lobster for 40mins, it wasn't even fresh. Horrible service, even the bill took 15mins to come. :flag: yani fena diil guzel kokteyller ictik sarhos olduk klasik bi deniz kasabasi atmosferi iyi iste alternatif tipler hastasi olabilir :flag: Order a pounder and be happy with yourself. üòç :flag: Come midweek - incredible value! :flag: BBQ blowout is a great sharing dish :flag: Love this place - lobster mac and cheese is amazing! :flag: If you like hot wings, try the voodoo chicken wings - really good. :flag: Lunch is a big rip off if you don't stick to the lunch specials. Pulled pork also VERY fatty and needs to be trimmed better. :flag: The prawns as a starter are kind of worth it for the wow factor. The bacon is just two pieces. Not worth it. I think the lobster roll is bigger than Lobster & Steak's. :flag: Awful place. Average bbq, poor service and something gross in the bottom of my pint glass. Oh and automatic service charge under the guise of 'discretionary'. Avoid :flag: Very loud but great for meat lovers. Wide selection of whiskies and happy hour every day 5 - 7pm! :flag: The boozy lemonade is amazing! :flag: My favourite Big Easy because they have a better selection of beers on tap here and you must try the beef brisket!! :flag: Portions are huge and delicious. Service could have been a bit better. :flag: Massive portions. Super tasty. :flag: The food is great but the booze is expensive! :flag: Love the place, food is great.. The only thing i don't like is the background music is still playing despite the loud chatter of the guests.. :flag: Warning: The taster bbq plate big enough to feed two. Not kidding! Of the bbq things, brisket is best IMO. :flag: Go for the lobster. It's not super big, it's enough though. It was very tasty. The service was very good. Obviously is fish, is not cheap. :flag: I don't need to write anything here other than A M A ZING! :flag: Yummy food, good whisky collection :flag: This is average, expensive BBQ food and weak cocktails. Bodeans is cheaper for similar quality or try some of the many alternatives listed on 4sq. :flag: Definitely one of the best bbq place in London. The pulled pork sandwich is amazing. Avoid starters as I believe they're not so great. Meat is the way to go! Swap the fries for the beans :flag: Food is amazing...service was sooooo slow. Shame. :flag: –ë–æ–ª—å—à–∏–µ –ø–æ—Ä—Ü–∏–∏, –≤–∫—É—Å–Ω–æ, –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–ø–µ—Ü-–ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è :flag: Bad service! The waiter forgot my order and I waited almost 30 minutes for my food. And they came back to me and said: nothing was ordered ( as if I was imaging I order some lobster) I won't go again! :flag: Put on your bib, roll up 'em sleeves and dig in. The appetizer combo is perfect for groups. Excellent wings, calamari and fried pickles. Also, get the lobster fest for a great seafood selection. :flag: With the pre theatre menu we got about ¬£60 worth of food and drink for ¬£22.50. I was really impressed and it was one of the best meals I've ever had! :flag: The Lobster with garlic & herbs butter is very good!!! Nice taste. The service wasn't good and neither the cocktails ( I'm very disappointed with the Pi√±a Colada) :flag: The lobsters are great! :flag: Great BBQ and service while we were there. Food was tasty and a good choice on the menu. Large airy restaurant, fun relaxing atmosphere. Will defiantly go back. :flag: Enjoyed the brisket and lobster, chips n coleslaw not so great.... :flag: Best ribs I have ever had :flag: On Tuesdays, take the special of the day (unlimited battered prawns) you won't regret. I also recommend the lobster, any time any day, you have to try it. It's a bit loud tho :flag: 20 pounds for a whole lobster and fries. :flag: Great Steak, great Mac n cheese, staff really friendly and music rockin. :flag: Fast service but secret charges not told about until you get the bill :flag: Lobster...obviously! Nice and simple with drawn butter. :flag: Come for quantity not for quality. Also, my steak was supposed to be medium & it looked exactly like my friend's that was rare :flag: Great value in London! Live music and sharing platter - lobster and/or chickens - Enjoy! :flag: We seen a mouse walking around and the manager simply doesn't believe us ! Not go !!! :flag: if you want to have an american experience in london this is the place you have to go. friendly staff and you can listen to some music live :flag: Lunch special is amazing value at ¬£10 for three courses. :flag: ¬£20 for a full lobster, salad, really crispy chips and a drink! Lobster was tastier than Burger & Lobster! Better value and great atmosphere! :flag: Not the best BBQ. Slow service. Ribs not tender at all and over done. :flag: Avoid! The food was horrible and not like the Kings road location. I can't begin to describe. Even the drinks were bad. There are much better places to eat in the area!!!!! :flag: The food very nice & friendly staff :flag: Big, loud, expensive and touristy. There are far better BBQ places in London :flag: Get the surf and turf. Abuse the butter-based dipping sauce. :flag: Portions are massive!! You've been warned :) :flag: Limitless Shrimp? More like limitless fries served with shrimp. But patience pays.LOBSTERS!!! :flag: The lobster is amazing- also the atmosphere is better than the Kings road restaurant. :flag: Friendly service, pretty decent bbq and lobster, great slushy drinks. :flag: Lunch menu is great value :flag: Everything good but I really liked the baked beans. :flag: Amazing food and ambience!! Liked the salmon. :flag: I've had the ribs before and were delicious but my recent visit I ordered ribs again. They were really tough and not tender like the first. Disappointed :flag: AP:BigEasy | Pass: easywifi :flag: Buraya gelip de lobster yemeden d√∂nme, cidden iyi... :flag: Big dishes and cool atmosphere. Thursdays is steak+lobster+drink for 23 pounds. The steak was dry but the lobster and the butter sauce were great. They've got live music downstairs. :flag: Loved the fillet and the lobster!!! :flag: Come with an empty stomach! The food is amazing, especially the ribs and pork belly. Great service as well, impressive as its always busy :flag: Hostess is a bitch. Empty tables but she refuses to accomodate us because we are early for our booking. Poor customer service :flag: Love the environment there and the lobster fiesta! Always too busy though! :flag: Avoid the chicken but leave room for dessert!! :flag: Authentic American style crabshack. Some great value options on the menu including whole lobster & a drink for ¬£20. Have the Bar-B-Q blowout if you're starving! :flag: Th√© only good thing is th√© friendly staff. I ordered the roll, the bread was too crunchy, the fries was dry and the lobster meat loaded with mayo sauce :flag: Good food but ridiculous portions. We had starters plus a sharing platter and ended up taking home 1kg meat! :flag: Meat, meat and more meat. All you can eat BBQ on a Monday. It might not blow your socks off but it beats other BBQ competition around the area. :flag: Good value ! Nice decoration ! :flag: Great food ..... :flag: Baked seafood platter is delicious, highly recommended! :flag: Good sharing platters for large groups and tasty steaks! :flag: Good food. Great chocolate and peanut butter milkshake. Ribs and pulled pork were tasty, lots of flavour. Didn't enjoy the bbq chicken. Staff were friendly and attentive. :flag: Had the BBQ sharer! Massive massive servings for a reasonable price. Great bluesy music and fitting decor.  Southern American dining at its best :flag: Try the Miami Vice cocktail with Havana Club rum :flag: Lunch menu is very good value. :flag: Go to the original (and smaller) restaurant in Fulham. This place has gone super-sized for the tourists and has lost some of the charm of the original. Food here wasn't anything to write home about. :flag: Food amazing, lobster fest great deal kids menu added bonus. Service horrible surrounded by dirty tables 3 different waiters, everything took forever. Ruined lunch for kids, staff just not attentive!! :flag: Everything excellent - huge portions, great value early/late deals, huge whiskey selection. Ribs, shrimp, lobster, steak all great. Stunning space too. :flag: Everything! But famous for its' brisket! :flag: Amazing BBQ! Huge whiskey bar also! The ribs are so soft and juicy! :flag: Great food and large portions. Test the ribs, they awsome. :flag: OMG -- so authentic, fantastic casual BBQ dining. The sharing platter is a paleo-tastic protein bomb :flag: One of the best lunch deals in London. ¬£10 for an app, main with sides, and a drink. Love this place and great food! :flag: USA (Around the World in London) :flag: Hands down the best selection of bourbon I have ever seen...either side of the pond! :flag: Watch the World Cup with bibs on, ribs in hand and kick back with one of the 300 whiskies. :flag: Order before 6pm for 2 courses and a cocktail only ¬£9.95! :flag: Mmmm, BBQ. :flag: All the steaks are delicious! Ask for their ketchup bc it's amazing (made with juicy Italian tomatoes üòã) :flag: Meat is excellent and the portions are huge, if only it was the same with the cocktails, they are too small for More than 8 pounds and it s a way too loud! :flag: Wifi pass: easywifi :flag: Incredibly average. The home-cooked barbecue experience expanded over too many floors, feels like a massive chain. Portions are huge but you can get much better food at similar places. :flag: Lobster wonderful !!!! :flag: Antipasti sono  buoni!!!!! :flag: –í–∫—É—Å–Ω—ã–π –∫—Ä–∞–±. :flag: Lobster fest deal is value for money! Steaks are yummilicious too!! :flag: Really disappointing experience. Chicken wings were undercooked (still bleeding on the inside) no onion rings on the menu and run out of pulled pork! Nothing like the Chelsea version...... :flag: Really good and lots of food review on www.lifeofshayan.com :flag: Great service, the team are brilliant. Crab claws are amazing, fingers and tools get every bit out. Ribs, excellent. :flag: Grab your bibs folks, it's time to tuck in to some smoky ribs and slushie cocktails. Upstairs admire the 500-bottle bar, or head down to The Shelter for nightly live music and on-tap cocktails. :flag: Awesome place. Go for the ribs and brisket. :flag: Amazing! Have one of their Old Fashioned's to start and go big on the food! :flag: Good food, drinks and an excellent atmosphere. Nice ambiance and quick attentive service, even when busy. The management has done an excellent job! :flag: Smoke salmon and egg bagel was so good. :flag: Probably the best coffee in the area. :flag: Cheeseburger :flag: Best fries I‚Äôve ever had! :flag: For sure not healthy food as it is a fast-food chain ,but burger was delicious and in a good price!And how cool is it that they have a soda machine with around 100 different flavours?!?! :flag: best burgers ever! :flag: The milkshakes are way too sweet! :flag: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ∑ÿßÿ∑ÿ≥ ŸÑÿ∞ŸäŸäŸäÿ∞ÿå ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸÇÿ± ÿ™ŸÉÿ±ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿπŸÖŸá :flag: Tu preparas la hamburguesa a tu gusto, y las papas est√°n frescas :flag: One of the best branches of Five Guys!

And peanuts to help you while they prepare you food. :flag: Do try their roasted peanuts which can be found at several spots throughout the place, look for the boxes! :flag: Average McDonald's style burgers and cheap tasting milkshakes. Great chips though :flag: One of my all time favourite fast food burger joints. Burgers are delicious and the milkshake selections are fantastic. You should definitely come here for a good bite. :flag: Just like in the States, a superb 'no-bullshit-burger', wide range of soda...and fair prices. :flag: Good milkshakes in a pinch :flag: Hey, it's Five Guys = awesome! :flag: Very good burgers and tasty meat! :flag: I really like their lettuce wrapped burgers. For high protein low carbs diet their are great. I add cheese bacon and mayo and its quite tasty. :flag: Tamam hamburgerler gayet lezzetli ama bi alex deƒüil...Ayrƒ±ca papates kola ile min. 15-16 pound para bence gereksiz... :flag: 10% price increase!

Fries huge portions and very tasty. üòçüòçüçîüçü :flag: Went for the most expensive bacon cheeseburger expecting a treat but what i got was old, stale and squished bun, chewy and cold bacon, overcooked and completely tasteless meat. Very disappointed. :flag: Le concept est int√©ressant, choisir un burger de base, ajouter les l√©gumes et sauce, mais les prix sont tr√®s √©lev√©s pour du fastfood, et la moiti√© des frites jet√©es dans le sac. :flag: Harika hamburger ve patates kƒ±zartmasƒ± yapƒ±yorlar.

Keep it single with tomato , raw onion , cheese , mayo and ketchup :flag: Location is good. The concept is cliche. The portions were adequate. Nothing else impressed me. :flag: Good burgers and great chips. Be prepared to queue but they do offer free peanuts while you stand in the queue :flag: Always crowded specilly in weekends :flag: All the way with jalape√±os with small cajun fries :flag: DAYUUUUUUUM! De las mejores hamburguesas que he comido. Patatas fritas en aceite de cacahuete, quedan crujientes por fuera y blanditas por dentro. Y el batido... ESPECTACULAR. :flag: Milkshake will all the toppings you want! :flag: 1) Add bacon, it's soo crisp! 2) Do it "all the way", but skip the mushrooms. 3) Take the small fries, they're enough for two! 4) Take unlimited soda, marvel at the soda machines and taste EVERYTHING :flag: ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸàŸàŸàÿ® ‚ù§Ô∏è :flag: Feels very fresh and homemade.

These burgers are just excellent! just 1 drawback: fries must be ordered separately. :flag: Always a good choice :flag: One of d Best burger :flag: This is what guilty pleasure is all about. Good burgers, fair prices and amaaaazing fries (I dare you to find a more generous portion). :flag: Oh my wow. The only thing to beat it would be in-n-out burger an that's a loooong way away :flag: Over-rated, there are better burger joints in the city but it is easier to sit down and have a meal. :flag: Apart from the Dophins hats I can't fault the food or service. Excellent! @nfluk #packers üèàüçî :flag: Grandes raciones de patatas y cacahuetes gratis :flag: Juicy meat, bold flavors and simply the best. :flag: Typical Five Guys... A lot less crowded since the opening last year. :flag: The burgers are good but compared to all the homemade what-so-ever burgers shops only average size and taste wise. Good think you can built the burger your own way and have enough fries for ever üòã :flag: Obama is right, indeed this is the best burger I ever had! Have the little cheeseburger, select what other toppings you want, a small fries and the drink selection is huge! Not expensive! Love it! :flag: Bit dissapointing :flag: They always do a very good burger and you can pick everything that goes on it yourself. But it just got too much of a McDonald's feel to it and for this price, no thank you. Stick to honest burger. :flag: Enormous burgers and 100s of soda combinations :flag: My tip is the bacon burger with jalapeno pepers !!! :flag: Best burgers :flag: Cant get enough ‚ù§Ô∏è :flag: When someone asks you if you've had Five Guys, they're not talking about the burger place. :flag: For the full American burger joint experience. Huge portions and very greasy but that's why you go here, right? :flag: Below average and burger doesn't meet the expectation! ŸÖŸà ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÇÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÖÿπŸá :flag: Free toppings.

Mask faces Staff but smooth flow at the counter, they got you right from the start. Eating a burger with knife & forks yup that will be me , avoiding the mess :flag: Probably the best on its category (between Mac/BK and Byron/GBK) :flag: The best burger ever eaten. :flag: Burgers is so nice :flag: Where the tasty burger in :flag: Trooooop bon mais vraiment pas donn√© !

Too much noise, burguer too much cooked and everything more expensive than other places.

Not to be missed if you are a burger person, you can also spot celebrities coming in for a quick bite. :flag: Don't hesitate to try :flag: Good food, be warned i with the drink machine. Don't mix too many flavours! :flag: It's overrated, normal fastfood burger.. I liked the wide choice of toppings. It wasn't bad so it's fine to try it if you never yet. Maybe hearing (the best burger is town)a lot made people believe it :flag: It's delicious :flag: Just ok. Though the amount of fries served is unbelievable. :flag: The Best burger&cips. :flag: If you want to eat a really American burgers you should go to five guys :flag: It all looked a bit messy, but thats how a burger at a fast food joint is allowed to look like üçîüçî :flag: Las papas a la francesa estilo cajun son muy buenas. :flag: It should be double burger to feel the taste of it :flag: Love the spicy fries ;) :flag: Good basic cheeseburger. They have brought the unlimited refill soft drink machine they have in USA and it has tons of options :flag: Imagine best things about fast foods (speed, price and choice "take away") and original burger restaurants (quality ingredients,personal care and style) together, thats Five Guys fast food restaurant! :flag: Not sure why this place is so popular. Expensive price (in comparison to quality - meant to be between McD and Gourmet?), very very overcooked burger, soggy fries. Only good thing is the free peanuts :flag: Love the burgers and the fries. :flag: burger with free toppings up to your choice..

Satisfying but completely rubbish compared with the quality burger joints found around London. Not that fast either. :flag: Expensive but good burgers :flag: The toppings and fries makes difference. The burger itself is much like a street kitchen one. People who say it is expensive is comparing it to McDonalds -which is wrong. Overall: I'll be back. :flag: As of January 2014 it's closed for refurb :flag: In my opinion one of the best burger venues in London. They give you free refills for your drinks and plenty of chips. Free peanuts while queuing. Excellent! :flag: I love this place!!! :flag: La mejor hamburgesa :flag: Best burger in L-town üá¨üáß‚ù§Ô∏è :flag: Best burger I've had.

Oh and try the 1001 varieties of soft drinks while you there! üëç :flag: Not too much but it is good. Fries was so spicu for me. And double cheeseburger is enough big if u are human :)) :flag: Small fries is more than enough, believe me. :flag: One of the best burgers i've ever tasted üçîüíó :flag: The little cheeseburgers are single patty, and the regular cheeseburgers are doubles. So expensive, but sometimes you just want a burger the American way :flag: Really enjoyed the big cheeseburger with plenty of free toppings. Very juicy burger and the drinks fountain is also great fun. :flag: Tasty lobster, great slushy cocktails, and nice American style interior. Only issue was the poor service. :flag: ŸäŸÖÿ≠ÿØŸàŸÜŸá ÿßŸÑÿÆŸàÿßÿ¨ÿßÿ™ ŸÜÿ®Ÿä ŸÜÿ£ŸÉŸÑ ŸÖŸÜŸá ŸàŸÜÿπŸÑŸÖŸÉŸÖ Ÿàÿ¥ Ÿàÿ∂ÿπŸá :flag: Over rated. Waiting staff is helpful but hostess has no idea. Disappointing to see the organization ruining the patrons experience. :flag: Gone downhill. They never have large lobsters anymore. When i telephone to ask they spin some lies that they cant say over the phone. Service has deteriorated significantly. :flag: Tasty and affordable lobster and steaks. All you can eat barbecue on Mondays and Shrimp on Tuesday's. Delicious voodoo shrimp appetizer. Easy to over eat here. :flag: Tasteless food, very dry beef patties, very dry burger altogether - live music was good but too loud! Wouldn't recommend! :flag: The lunch deal here is incredible. Steak. :flag: ŸÑÿßÿ™ŸÇÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÜÿ≠ÿ¥ :flag: Burger was awesome, atmosphere and service are excellent, great experience ! I would definitely come again here :flag: Surf and turf  american restaurant, noisy and friendly and sometimes hectic  but making for a good night out especially if you like lobster and a lively ambiance. :flag: Had a fabulous Thanksgiving dinner - that mac and üßÄ was üòã. :flag: Great atmosphere , extremely friendly crew and good food. Juicy and tender chicken  lux burger was yummy üëèüèº :flag: Lux chicken burger is delicious !! Service is quick and friendly. Good atmosphere :flag: Love big easy !!

They have daily offers too.  I'll definitely go back to try some more dishes. :flag: Lobster, not steak. :flag: Awsome LOBSTER! Spectacular RIBS! Tasty MARGARITA! They do know how treat people :) :flag: Great atmosphere, live music, awesome shakes. Lobster feast is a great deal with lobster, sides and a drink. Ribs are tasty but ginormous, go for a half-rack if you're a small eater or not too hungry :flag: The food here is soo good! It's a lively authentic atmosphere with. delicious smells filling the restaurant!  I would definitely go back. Plus they have some really great cocktails! :flag: A great little taste of home at the Big Easy. Tuesday nights are fantastic for the country girl with all you can eat shrimp. Special thanks to the wait staff for helping us celebrate a friend's bday! :flag: Favourite American crabs hack in London. Warming setting and cosy dining experience with delicious and large portion of food! :flag: Amazing lobster with fries and salad (lobster fest). Value for money :flag: Deliciousüëåüèº Roasted potato crisp yumm + iron skillet smores :flag: Huge portions and a lively atmosphere :flag: Lobster, ribs, chicken wings, mac'n'cheese :flag: The lunch special is great value! :flag: Amazing American cuisine. Mussels in garlic cream sauce, BBQ ribs and lobster roll are must try. Not to forget the delicious sticky toffee pudding to end the mouthwatering meal :flag: Baby Ribs. :flag: This place is my all time favourite restaurant in London! Definitely try everything on the menu. It's all so damn good you will find it hard to choose!! :flag: Lobster is incredible :flag: Amazing menu,delicious food,crowded place,dirty hands after dinner:) :flag: Different offers every day! :flag: Seafood was amazing! :flag: Lobster and ribs are amazing! :flag: Unfortunately each time I've been the service has been very poor. Food is good but not worth the poor service :flag: Great service yummy food :flag: Yummy lobster! :flag: Excellent, meaty lobster :flag: Not a place for a vegetarian. There are only two vegetarian dishes, and both are awesome. This place is great if you are a sea food lover. :flag: Try the voodoo wings! The crab! The frozen margaritas! Eat it all! Has an authentic American feel. :flag: Tuesday is shrimps all you can eat, Wednesday is fajitas all you can eat. Lobster roll is excellent too. :flag: I love this place! Great food! Great staff! :flag: Frozen margaritas FTW :flag: Ribs, lobster, steaks, surf and turf, frozen margarita :flag: Lobster and ribs are great :flag: Would definitely recommend the Voodoo wings, classic cocktail and the unlimited shrimp but be warned, the shrimp are large and tasty! üëçüòÖ :flag: Seafood is good. Pity there's no brisket here. :flag: Different menu from their Covent Garden branch. They don't serve the brisket here which is delicious, and for the beer drinkers, they don't have craft beers on tap. More seafood-heavy. Great dailies. :flag: I like the strawberry milkshake and lobster! :flag: One of my favourites! Consistently good food and friendly service. The ribs are amazing :flag: The lobster here is to die for! America loves a meat / fish combo and that's exactly what you can expect here. :flag: Love the lobster and the food. One waiter is not that good. He was a bit rude :flag: The welcome girl (blonde) is quite rude and annoying. She's so discriminative to the foreigners. Someone should tell her that beauty is not enough when you are in food service industry. :flag: Bom servi√ßo, comida razo√°vel... :flag: Everything Lobster and Steak :flag: The place is crazily crowded but it's worth a try ! I ordered the "Lobster Festival", didn't like the salad and the fries but the lobster was absolutely delicious  ‚ù§Ô∏è :flag: Great surf and turf. Never had a bad meal here. Beef ribs were great and hearty. Washed down with a Steam Anchor ale. :flag: Voodoo wings - all the way. Best I've found so far. :flag: Canadian lobster at very competitive prices! :flag: The price of the Lobster is really Expensive >< :flag: The buffalo chicken wings are possibly the best I've had in London but I wouldn't rate anything else on the menu.. My chicken salad was so soggy, it did not look fresh at all.. I couldn't even eat it :flag: extremely crowded steakhouse. Very friendly and quick service. Lots of surf & turf and bbq options. Bbq chicken extremely good, ribs not so, jumbo shrimps excellent. Order the berry pavlova. HUGE :flag: All you can eat ribs and a beer for 16.95? Yes sir. :flag: Lobster festivAl. Ask to change the garlic sauce for hollandaise..much better! :flag: Not the cheapest, but boy is it satisfying. :flag: Lobster for ¬£20 #cantgowrong - favourite place for years love it here!!! :flag: Margarita is delicious,burgers are so so :flag: Came here once before and it was devine. Came again and we were seated downstairs which smelt of damp. Mussels in the lobster bake were definitely off so had the all you can eat shrimp- they were ok :flag: Don't get mussels , they smell of athletes foot :flag: Amazing jumbo shrimp! :flag: Very good atmosphere and different dishes supported with various drinks and cocktails. Loved it! :flag: Frozen margaritas and slab of ribs yum yum :flag: It's official!  The best sticky toffee pudding in London! :flag: Great food but slow service :flag: Good but expensive always book! :flag: Absolutely fabulous!!! Luv luv luv it!!! :flag: Amazing service and top atmosphere. We went on a Tuesday for the "all you can eat shrimp" - the shrimp were humongous and delicious. Frozen margarita was great too. :flag: Lobster festival is great! Fried shrimp is to die for. :flag: Thursday's deal is a 1.5lb lobster, steak and fries with free beer or frozen margarita for ¬£20! Very good. :flag: Same price on the lobster as Burger and Lobster for a 2lb lobster, salad, fries, but here you also get a frozen margarita or beer, all for 19.95. Ribs and clam chowder were great too! We will be back! :flag: You need to order drinks at the bar for happy hour deals. Nice if the sign was visible. :flag: Don't try the lobster roll ! Its horrible and tastes as if it was marinated in a swimming pool "chlorine" ! :flag: Book in advance as its popular! :flag: Really great food and atmosphere!  The BBQ ribs are the best I have had and if you like the sound of alcoholic milkshakes they have the best I have tasted! :flag: Omg what is in the voodoo sauce ????? It's amaze!!!!!!!! :flag: Famtastic !!!! :flag: Food is great. Don't go for the standard stuff (burgers etc) this is a seafood BBQ place so surf and turf, ribs, lobster, crab, and shrimps are your best bet. I've never had decent table service here. :flag: One of my favourite places in the city for many years & an important test for a potential mate! Grab a bib and a margarita, and tuck into some ribs! Not for the faint-hearted, nor the small-stomached. :flag: Thursday is fresh lobster and steak night, well worth the trip to Chelsea :flag: pretty poor service. The food is good, just don't sit at the tables in the bar area unless you want to get shoved all through your meal! :flag: Check out some of their midweek specials, like steak and lobster for ¬£19.50 on a Thursday. Steak - good, lobster - good, ribs - good... get the picture? :) :flag: Fantastic place, Alexandra is so good waitresss, food is delicios. :flag: Sit downstairs. The atmosphere is authentic. :flag: Great! No major complaints (yes there was a service charge and did ask for tip but no big deal) my grilled chicken salad was amazing, and my friend is still raving about his burger, two days on.. :flag: Great ribs! :flag: Its just an amazing place, the best lobster or burger whatever you prefer and the best wine list;))) :flag: If you're having the all you can eat rib deal - get plenty of water! :flag: Look on the blackboard for the daily specials! The cocktails & fried food are very yummy, but the shellfish, especially the larger lobsters (2lb+), tend to be overcooked. 12.5% service charge. :flag: Love the lobster and also their frozen margarita. Ôòâ :flag: buffalo wings! :flag: Ne ratez pas leur offre homard √† ¬£14.99 (un homard, des frites, salade et boisson)tous les jours de 12h √† 18h. C'est un regal! :flag: Steaks and lobsters are delicious ,good music and great margarita! :flag: The ribs are YUM :flag: Forget the under 600g steaks.. Won't go wrong! :flag: The scorpion bowl is the best way to enjoy an evening with friends. Get a great night started the right way :flag: All you can eat shrimp Tuesday, lobster & steak Thurs! :flag: It's actually 2 for 1 cocktails and the cocktails need to be the same :flag: Tues - Fri, 5:30 - 7:30pm 2 of the same cocktails for ¬£7.45 :flag: If you‚Äôre too nervous to say it, just repulse them, grab food off their plate, eat with your mouth open and get dirty‚Ä¶ then, go in for a kiss. :flag: Service is terrible. Never again! Wish I had my money back! :flag: Service is terrible. Never again! :flag: 20 year's old and it has hardly changed, mostly because it doesn't have to. The live music, frozen cocktail, Yankee rib shack formula works, which is why it's never empty. :flag: One of our favorite surf & turf joint in London! Don't be shy to get your hands dirty, first date or not!! :flag: Love the food here! Burgers, steaks, seafood - its all delish. Can be pricey but they usually have deals on. If you go during dinner, it can get packed so its best to reserve a table. :flag: Be sure to get a bib when you come in here, it can get a little messy in this Kings Road classic. :flag: Come on a Monday for all you can eat BBQ. Amazing! :flag: Don't order the colossal prawn cocktail!!!! Frozen and tasteless. BUT pulled pork is damn tasty. :flag: Monday and Wednesdays are deal days. Better than Bodeans and a great atmosphere and decor. Mondays are all you can eat BBQ days and they mean it! :flag: Its a good place to visit. :flag: Step inside and be transported back to the States! Amazing steaks and burgers.....also have BBQ ribs and chicken as well as fresh seafood. Great wine list. Very fun! :flag: One of the most fun restaurants I have ever been to, and amazing value - half a lobster and a margarita = ¬£14.95 :flag: Great fried jumbo shrimps! Go on a Thursday for the Surf and Turf deal! Whole lobster, sirloin steak, salad, fries and a beer - ¬£20!!! EDIT: 03/14 - aww looks like it's no longer a whole lobster... :flag: Wings here = god-on-a-stick. Actual North American wings. Funny story though : asked my waitress for Dijon mustard. She: wha? Me: French mustard. She: holding up plastic container, this IS FRENCH's :flag: All u can eat BBQ on Mondays is incredible! Get there early you don't want to be left out. :flag: Go to Bodeans...trust me. :flag: Wicked cocktails, and voodoo wings to die for!! :flag: Looking forward to munching on some ribs later... and of course singing loudly to SWEET HOME ALABAMA! :) :flag: to find out more click the link.... :flag: Good fresh oysters available all year round :flag: YES FOR RIBS :flag: Ribs are an absolute must! Lunch specials... oh yeaaah :flag: Get the frequent diner card - accumulate 10% in vouchers over time - it really adds up here, and of course they do it on the receipt for the whole order, so awesome when in with a big group! :flag: Alex is right, their bill includes 12.5% "service" then they ask for a tip on top! Pointed this out to the waitress who said one was service, one is gratuity! :flag: Great food but really poor service, really poor. Try Bodean's instead (Soho). :flag: Try the Lobster Festival deal - 1kg lobster, fries and a beer or margerita for ¬£15! Bargain! :flag: Great good & service... but note that even though service IS added to the bill, they leave an option to add MORE on the PDQ machine... :flag: All you can eat ribs on Monday nights. Let me just say that again .... All you can eat ribs. Get in :flag: Definitely get the clam chowder. The lobster special is spectacular too! :flag: Big portions. Great entertainment :flag: The sweet potato fries and what‚Äôs the beef burger (gluten free) were amazing! As a non-vegetarian, I thought it was great and didn‚Äôt taste artificial! :flag: The best vegan burger ever! I highly recommend the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the beef?‚Äù :flag: This is THE spot for burgers! Amazing flavours, textures and excellent variety! Always worth the trip! :flag: the pulled mooshie & the whats your beef burger were so good!!!! :flag: Tasty vegan burgers. Didn't like the cheesy sweet potato fries as the cheese was not melted. :flag: Really great quinoa and black bean burger. Sweet potato fries were delicious too, just wish the cheese had melted! :flag: Tasty but got a bit messy! Not a particularly welcoming place, fairly slow service and didn't seem that clean üòû :flag: Burgers here are huge in size and taste! :flag: Great vegan food! Onion bhaji burger was a firm favourite. Drinks are pricey. :flag: The burgers, sides and drinks are all excellent. Try the onion bhaji special (if is available.) :flag: Yummm the beef burger tastes like a Big Mac. Delicious üçîüçüüç∫ :flag: Delicious and very filling. Lots of napkins needed but totally worth it. Cheezy chip are to die for regardless of not being able to move after finishing. :flag: Filet-om-Fysh was a bit greasy, but delicious! I reckon it's enough on it's own without sides. :flag: The nice Nepalese girls behind the counter shouldn't be the only reason for your visits. It is a great place to buy healthy food and escape the lure of Big Mac and Mac chickens. :flag: Very friendly attend :flag: A large branch of the usual. Delicious sushi and I'm always ready for their katsu chicken! :flag: Choose your own favourites, tasty and fresh. Good value. :flag: Very limited seating so best to get take away only here :flag: The Spicy chicken is oh so good! :flag: Great Japanese fast food chain. Everything is fresh and tasty. :flag: Needs more chairs :( :flag: Roof top on sunny day is a great place to chill while waiting for your train. :flag: Cool roof terrace but fairly noisy. :flag: Smells weird. Poor service. "Can I swap the fries for sweet potato please?"  "No". :flag: This is the sister venue to The Big Chill Bar in Brick Lane, and to a now defunct UK festival. :flag: Roof top and good atmosphere :flag: Amazing rooftop. :flag: The staff is amazing if you intrract :flag: Great bar selection, big venue with plenty of room :flag: The Big Chill House is a cool bar and events space in King‚Äôs Cross with a roof terrace, craft drinks, delicious food, and DJs every Friday and Saturday until 3am. A spinoff of the Big Chill Festival.. :flag: Go to the rooftop, grab a beer, and get munching on a burger. Great little hidden gem. :flag: Nice cosy rooftop in a sunny day :flag: Head to the rooftop for some much needed air in the kings cross area :flag: Perfect place for beers after work. Big and beautiful place. Good service. :flag: Nice bar near Kings X. Quite a good variety of drinks and craft beers. Good place for drinks with friends. :flag: Cocktails and good draught beer. :flag: Had lots of fun here. Great venue; has a homely feel to it. Enjoyed the cocktails on offer and the music was immense. Would definitely recommend to those travelling in groups. :flag: Did not explore it fully but it seems a good place for a drink or two and not too crowded :flag: You need to have the Bourbon Slush cocktail. Wow. :flag: Awesome rooftop and delicious BBQ! :flag: Ace cocktails, often rammed yet excellent roof terrace, games room & comfy booths, massive plates of nachos. I am a total fan of this joint. :flag: The roof terrace is pretty nice on a sunny day. :flag: This place is bigger than you think! Lots of hidden rooms and a roof balcony :flag: Really cool place to go on a sunny day and it looks like they have good events but ¬£4.50 for a bottle of Desperados so kind of overpriced. The roof terrace is nice as well! :flag: Delicious strawberry version of Long Island Iced Tea with a bit of champaigne :flag: What is the password for wifi? :flag: If you're going there for a late pub lunch  eat up quick as the music gets turned up so loud you have to shout at each other :flag: The lunch service was terrible. In addition to the food being wrong and cold, the servers were rude and then the manager refused to apologize for the horrible service. :flag: Check out the roof garden, its massive! :flag: Very good burgers and fries :flag: Extremely rude security staff. :flag: Really liked how chilled and relaxed the roof garden is. Bring a jug from downstairs and you're set. :flag: Great music! One of my favourite clubs except recently, my mates and I were hit on by such aggressive man-babies. One, who after grabbing my tit thought I was playing hard to get by shoving him off. :flag: Check out the dining area tucked away at the back! :flag: Now has the best urban terrace, with bar, bbq and allotment!! :flag: 10% off drinks if you are a student. 3.60 for a pint of cider :flag: Big Chill Burger is amazing! :flag: ¬£5 pint, Leeds it ain't :flag: Great Breakfast! :flag: Crap sound system but friendly enough and the burgers are tasty. :flag: Nice coffee. Contrary to someone's tip, it doesn't smell like piss. Good for watching cars/people go by. :flag: Great place! :flag: For dull people with nothing better to do. Avoid. Unless you are one of those people with no idea. :flag: Bacon done "right" in the mornings :flag: Creative breakfasts. Endless coffees. :flag: Get a pitcher of Rum and Ting cocktail for 19.50. Thank me later. :flag: Don't forget the rooftop garden on a sunny summer's day - no service up there, usually, but well worth carrying your drinks up those flights of steps. :flag: delicious cocktails and food! You Must get a burger while you are here :flag: Gorgeous beer garden, but gets rammed later in the week :flag: Newly reopened. Check out the miniature games room on the first floor, with table football and Monopoly stuck to the ceiling for some reason. :flag: Going through a Hip hop phase - which is a good thing, imho - "Scratch" is back on the 31st April (Free all night). But please, no drunken amateur breakers. :flag: On a sunday hit the roof terrace! Sweet. (Door to the left of the bar) :flag: Find a FREE copy of Catch 22 Magazine here! Can't find yourself a copy? Visit www.catch22mag.com and view it online! :flag: Pacha Fail & Brick Lane Fail! Big Chill House won the match again! :flag: Go to dance electro and get drunk! :flag: Try the roof terrace :flag: The worst cocktails I have ever ever had, ever. And I'm not being a snob. I tried three and they all tasted like vomit, especially the monkey one. Foul. :flag: watch #worldcup 2010 here :flag: Get in during the happy hour. 4-6 :flag: Stinks of piss, feels like home. :flag: Go upstairs to the beer garden. That is all. :flag: Pollo milanese is good, but should come with pasta, ie spaghetti. :flag: Cute place with great hot chocolate and coffee. :flag: Just another Carluccio's, a pretty spacious one. Not a big fan of their food, finding it a bit bland personally,  but they're a reasonable choice to have brunch or dessert.. :flag: Pasta Faggioli Soup, and in general everything I've tasted here so far is great. Don't skip it. :flag: Meringue to die for :flag: Thank you Steffani for remarkable friendly service! Wonderful service. ÿßŸÑÿÆÿØŸÖÿ© ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπÿ© ! :flag: Recommended for breakfast. :flag: the best espresso I've ever tasted! Try the rich flavor :flag: Probably the most inefficient place in London!!!! Such a shame as they have decent products, someone must teach then how to manage this queue properly ... Makes it a very annoying experience :flag: Try tortino di tonno, it's delightful! :flag: A very nice place. Though its better for a breakfast than a proper "italian" dinner. The morning take away service is lovely. Coffee is good and staff is very friendly. :flag: Ordered Focaccia and Cotoletta alla Milanese. The first was decent, the latter overcooked. Overall it didn't impress me. Perhaps, other dishes are better. :flag: ÎßõÎÇú ÌååÏä§ÌÉÄÎ•º 8-11ÌååÏö¥ÎìúÏóê, ÌôàÎ©îÏù¥Îìú ÎîîÏ†ÄÌä∏Î•º 3.5-6ÌååÏö¥ÎìúÏóê Î®πÏùÑ Ïàò ÏûàÎã§.

Shame, as we loved the hot chocolate and the serving staff adore dogs :flag: No longer dog friendly! After months of being told off when I don't bring my dog, we've just been turfed out! :flag: Skip the ravioli...but MUST have brownie!  To die for... :flag: Try the hot chocolate. It's rich and just perfect. :flag: Best selection of charcuterie in the neighbourhood, good value too :flag: Some say this is the McDonald's of Italian. But give me a glass of Montepulciano and a bowl of vongole over a big mac any day. :flag: Cozy and noisy place with nice and expensive food.. :flag: Come for the amazing Mac and Cheese and the cool environment. I love everything about this restaurant. Serves classic British food in big portions. The atmosphere was lively even on a Monday night. :flag: Lovely place and very classic. If you are going for brunch, you should get the eggs florentine üç≥ :flag: Best Mac&Cheese I have eaten so far! Amazing ambiance, extraordinary service, definitely will not let you down! :flag: Absolutely everything. Venison Wellington, Mac and cheese, pork chop, lychee martini! :flag: Excellent food. Excellent service. :flag: Food was less than regular. :flag: Beautiful brunch spot - order the brioche :flag: Impressively beautiful interior design. Due to the size and amount of people, it is fairly busy and has the atmosphere and noise level of a train station. Expensive!!!!! :flag: GQ recommends: Severn and Wye cured smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. The portions are very generous, but if you're hungry order with a side of toasted English crumpets. :flag: Mediocre food, beautiful decor :flag: This place is great. Good energy. A thoughtful cocktail menu. And a glorious atmosphere.  On the contrary, they thought you wouldn't notice their avocados are a prepackaged jelly poured out of a bag. :flag: Scrambled eggs on sourdough toast üëçüèº Devine üòã :flag: Her≈üey iyi :flag: Nice decor but weird mixed crowd and average food for what you pay. :flag: A very beautiful restaurant with friendly staff and delicious food :flag: I'm in love with the atmosphere, for the food, i would recommend you to try Mac & cheese üßÄ .. it deserves to cry on :flag: mac and cheese, add the ox cheek :flag: Worst meal I had per pound! Not worth it. This was my ¬£12 salad. Bit a cabbage and celery. Dont get the porkchops. :flag: Flaming Alaska!! Love it :flag: Amazing place! :flag: Best Mac and Cheese üëåüèº :flag: For a relatively cheap date, start off with a cocktail at the bar, order the Ox tail mac and cheese to share (its copious) and share a bottle of Malbec. :flag: Excellent cocktails and food. For such a large room, you'd think it would be noisy, but it was full and we could hear each other talk as well as the great music at an appropriate level. :flag: Great cocktails, try to sit in the bar. But the lobby does have pool to play :flag: Zucchini and aubergine toast with ricotta to die for ! Good French patisserie as well :flag: Impressive, trendy, Place to be :flag: Great venue for special occasions, plenty of vegetarian options including a delicious roasted cauliflower main, save room for dessert and try the dill or no dill cocktail. Delicious. :flag: The Mac and cheese is insane! And get the crab, very fresh and bright. :flag: Avocado toast for bfast :flag: Sea Bream was wonderful. Also great wine selection. :flag: Location & Ambiente üëç :flag: Pricey but absolutely worth it - a little bit of luxury just a stones throw from the mayhem of Oxford street. Go for one of the sharing punches üëèüèªüëèüèª :flag: Go for the drinks and atmosphere. Skip the food :flag: Chateau Briand with mac&cheese :flag: The chateau briand with mac&cheese is amazing!! A bit heavy though so definitely for at least 2 people. Yum though üëåüëåüëå :flag: Moroccan Egg is perfect :flag: Pancakes, waffles and eggs :flag: Funky place . The Mac and cheese was good . Nothing else was nice :flag: ƒ∞nterior design and tasty martinis :flag: Chia pot, fruit salad, avocado toast :flag: Lovely spot for brunch. Dressed crab, ham hock hash brown and apple eclair were all fab. Pork pie also great. Loved the dill or no dill cocktail. Super indulgent for a Sunday brunch treat! :flag: "Yuliya Mykhaylovska: Berner's Tavern for brunch. " :flag: Amazing botanical cocktails. Great food. Gorgeous venue. :flag: Recently changed drink menu with some enticing yet sometimes experimental concoctions. Work a few on the menu before going off just for fun. :flag: Good menu, wine list and service. Not too packed in. :flag: Amazing in every way. The main dining room is grandiose with high ceilings and walls covered with art. Food is fantastic. I had the crab meat as a starter. Amazing. Very good choice of wines as well. :flag: Awesome cocktails but no so amazing service :( :flag: Amazing interior and excellent food however service needs improvement :flag: Charming atmosphere and delicious chicken popcorn. :flag: For a sense of majesty in the morning, head to Berners Tavern, the London Edition Hotel‚Äôs fabulous new restaurant ‚Äì with luxurious interiors and an uptown atmosphere, its mysterious yet classy.. :flag: Another hit from Jason Atherton. Great ambience and surroundings and fantastic food :flag: One of my favorite spots in London. Can seem pretentious. But the interior design is stunning. Acoustic, not so much. Very noisy. Always packed. So book ahead! :flag: To die for : Apple caramel √©clair with salted caramel ice cream :flag: My new fav. spot in lodond coffee , desserts , breakfast , brunch everything is üëåüèº :flag: Perfect food but way too loud and the service is slow. :flag: Great filet (the fries "chips" and salad that comes with it are insanely good as well). But the real winner is the architecture and design of the venue. Chef Jason Atherton. :flag: Dining room is amazing. Bar itself is really nice, with plenty of space, pool table (referred to as billiards here) etc. Great cocktails also. :flag: Love hate relationship with this place. Every other time I eat here I love the food or hate it. Worth a meal though. Gorgeous inside. :flag: One of the nicest dining rooms in London. Open with a Vintage Vesper. Then order the Mac and cheese with oxtail and bone marrow. Just don't expect to be able to eat again. For a week. :flag: The hazelnut waffles is amazing :flag: Lovely place for great breakfast . Egg penidict , waffle and smoked salmon for unforgettable taste  . :flag: My second favorite breakfast place in London üíó Buttermilk pancakes, Hazelnut waffles , and Yoghurt with berries and honey üíØ :flag: Sunday Roast is great value for money in an amazing dining room. :flag: Extraordinary, breathtaking, inspired, careful, generous cooking in an absolutely jaw-dropping room. Reserve in advance, but do go. Comes at a price, though. :flag: Very classy :flag: The architecture is so insanely stunning. Burrata was a bit hard, but tomatoes lovely. Solid filet. Great chips. The cheesecake like mouse was INSANE. :flag: Mac and cheese :flag: Artichoke and mushroom risotto from the new lunch menu is a must! :flag: Great ambiance. :flag: Fancy venue for a special occasion. Excellent food and service! :flag: Great place for eating and drinking breakfast is well worth the visit. :flag: Lovely place for a cocktail or a private dining event. Food was tasty but must try the mint ice cream - great blend of refreshing and herby yumminess :flag: Not a breakfast spot but a restaurant with a super cool cocktail bar (recommend the 'Cereal Killer' -  a White Russian made with milk soaked in coco pops -  whaaaaaaaat?) :flag: The burger. So good. :flag: Breakfast - poached egg avocado sandwich :flag: Insanely overpriced but it makes you feel like a king. The drinks and cocktail waitresses are both simply beautiful and delicious. :flag: You have to love a bartender that knows how to make a good drink...and every bartender at Berners can do this. Come for the drinks, stay for the scenery. :flag: Very cool deco. The sharing portions for 2 can actually feed 3-4. So plan ur orders! :flag: The mac'n'cheese pasta easily serves two if not more! Order the burrata as a starter and share it! :flag: Elegant, nice drinks :flag: Beautiful restaurant. There is a pool table in the bar outside for after dinner as well :flag: Berners Tavern is a proper ‚Äúbobby-dazzler‚Äù. It's a gastronomic heaven with a menu that satisfies all day long ‚Äì from breakfast fry-ups and lunchtime sandwiches to Josper grills and Sunday roasts. :flag: Love the atmosphere with the Amazon chandeliers and paintings. Food and wine was great but I expected a bit more. :flag: Brilliant atmosphere inside. Lovely staff and a very helpful sommelier made it an evening to remember. Pro tip: the lamb shoulder was just to die for. :flag: Amazing Atmosphere! Try the Dover Sole and Rib-Eye. Good for late supper as well! :flag: Grace Dent recommends the seafood platter and the steak. :flag: It was the restaurant of 2013. Bedecked with over 200 paintings and beautiful chandeliers. :flag: Get the quail to start or else.  The pesto with the halibut will ruin all other pestos for you. :flag: Beautiful interior. Great beef tartare :flag: Seriously amazing space. Here's your order: Dover sole, cauliflower gratin, and the chocolate cereal cocktail for dessert. All perfect. :flag: Book a table in the Punch Room for pre-dinner drinks ladled from silver sharing bowls by the fireside, then onto the resplendent dining room where you'll feel like you've stumbled into a film :flag: BAD for groups. They try to provide a limited menu for 9 or more...a selection of the most expensive items on the menu. Get the full a la carte menu, still expensive. :flag: Great ambiance and attached to the London Edition hotel. Food genuinely excellent. :flag: –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–µ–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –ø–æ–ø–∏—Ç—å –∫–æ—Ñ–µ. –û—Ç –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞–∫–∞ –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ—à—å –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–≥–æ :flag: Great cocktails (Dill or No Dill) and simple but solid entrees and appetizers.

Make sure you bring your appetite. :flag: Steak and cheese :flag: Try the special macaroni & cheese :flag: Amazing food! Only does brunch on sundays though! :flag: Undoubtedly a great dining experience for both brunch and dinner. Love the egg florentine, and delicious dinner starters. Superb interior design and ambient. Nice cocktails too. :flag: Perfect fish food ,everything wonderfull :flag: Roast lamb al punto ;) :flag: Amazing! Not many places can live up to the hype that their reputation carries. Food is honest and hearty, service is fantastic and you won't get bored looking around :flag: It's pretty much the most amazing dining took I've ever seen. Well worth just stopping by to have a drink at the very comfortable bar area. :flag: Contrary to the tips- I found the eggs peas and ham- underwhelming. The mac & cheese however is divine as are the oysters. :flag: Cocktails 'thyme traveller' & 'cereal killer' were both vey enjoyable :flag: Avocado on sourdough with poached eggs is a great healthy start to the day. :flag: Fab place hustle & bustle super good & great buzz you will love it ! :flag: Cocktails are brilliant - try the Dill or no Dill and the Cereal Killer :flag: Tatler Restaurant Awards 2014 - Taste of London Best New Restaurant Winner :flag: Tatler Restaurant Awards 2014 - Best Room Runner Up :flag: Must have: to try lobster prawn cocktail :flag: The Lamb shoulder to share is delicious but large - could feed 3-4! :flag: Exquisite ambiance, menu, wine list and service. :flag: Make sure you come here at least once before you die. Even the gnocchi (which I'm not keen on) was amazing! :flag: Staff at breakfast is not so friendly.  I guess nobody wants this shift. I hate begging for coffee. :flag: Get the ox tongue n cheek (with marrow) and die happy :flag: Lovely. Recommended :flag: Great drinks, outstanding service. Set yourself up with Eric at the bar if you can and have him make anything you want....but challenge yourself, he'll come thru. Great food, too! :flag: Amazing decor! :flag: You simply must get the Ham, eggs and peas to start. And the dessert is mind blowing - try the French Brioche an ginger sorbet. Heavenly! :flag: what a spectacular dining area! :flag: You MUST try one of the many signature cocktails...anyone...you can't go wrong... :flag: Very nice place, expensive cocktails, and I'm pretty sure we saw Kate Hudson! Worth the experience :flag: Oysters, egg and peas, duck- all delicious. One of the better meals I've had in London as of late. :flag: Classy setup let down by shoddy service... Lovely setting for a special occasion though. Full review on Scoff London: http://bit.ly/1fpzlUh :flag: Amazing presence and decor. Interesting cocktails, very good food, and leave room for desert as the menu is sensational. :flag: Brioche French Toast + Poached Eggs = perfect breakfast :flag: The caramel eclair is immense! We also shared the ox cheek & tongue dish - delicious. :flag: Desert menu is fab! :flag: Grab a seat at the bar in the Tavern and work your way through the impressive cocktails... :flag: Fantastic setting and food,  one of the best in London. :flag: Fish is amazing here, also the Ham, Egg and Peas. Probably the most spectacular dining room in London! :flag: Everyone here looks like Jeff Bezos :flag: fantastic overall.  oysters and seafood in particular :flag: Quite a spectacular dining room - worth the trip alone :flag: Awesome food & desserts, great atmosphere & fantastic service. :flag: Amazing decor, great service, tasty food. English breakfast can't be beat, and try anything with the duck egg. :flag: Wow! It's funny they call themselves a gastropub because it's definitely not! In fact, I think I found my new favourite place in London.. :flag: Ask for Mauricio as your waiter - he's the best. Also ask him about the beeches in Portugal :flag: O lugar √© bastante curioso e escuro mas os hamb√∫rgueres s√£o muito bons. Cuidado com a pimenta! :flag: I don't care if the food is good!

However it‚Äôs dark there and music is loud ‚Äúkind of irritating‚Äù. Worth a visit :flag: Good burgers and wings, recommend the buffalo wings and the fried pickles are interesting.

Also one of the few burger joints where chicken are just as good as beef ones (if not better... try the Buffalo chicken) :flag: Not the best restaurant but nice experience :flag: Good burgers and nice bar vibe.   Worst and most incompetent FOH service I've seen in a developed country.   Sat ourselves after watching 5 tables remain unoccupied for 45 min, host never noticed :flag: This place is insane I love it long waiting list though :flag: Hands down the best #burger in #London!! üòç This place reminds me a lot of #Berlin so it made me feel home but the taste of the burgers made me feel in like I'm in #heaven!! üëåüèº #nomnom #foodie :flag: It‚Äôs all about the spicy wings - but they are INSANELY hot!

WIN!! :flag: Best burger in town bar none. www.LDNfashion.net :flag: The Byron Burger is the best burger I have ever had in my life.

Avoid being served by the one with a mole on her right cheek! Seems like she'd rather be elsewhere! :flag: Love their burgers, always have done.

Do it. :flag: The onion rings knock the spots off any other I've had, make sure you try them :flag: Awesome place to stop off for a fast, top-notch burger.

It is a McDonald's... :flag: Eat upstairs it's much quieter. :flag: Try the burger :flag: Browny Mc Flurry man!! :flag: Try the new smoky bacon chicken Its really little and you only get 2 or 3 chicken bites so I would suggest you buy more than 1 my favourites are the chicken wrap with herb sauce and the big mac :flag: Dnt use the toilet, I saw george micheal In there. :flag: Buy a big mac, and jam a sixer of chicken nuggets in with it. Top stuff. :flag: Slightly confusing, but not too bad if you know where you're going :flag: In and around that train station there‚Äôs everything you could need.

Arrives in just under an hour and is pretty comfy. Chargers on the trains. :flag: #Stanstedexpress is just pointless. 23.4¬£ one way and 58 journey time. Use terravision or national express coach.

Ticket expensive and train filthy. :flag: If train is delayed, they issue a time for late departure. DON'T trust it. "The delayed departure time is merely a guide".

And the place is so crowded :flag: Love the Mac Chicken,it's tender n crispy..yum! :flag: go downstairs, lots of extra seats. not sure why everyone's crowding up there. :flag: Big Mac so old it had stuck to the box, half a thing of fries, all bundled into a bag in the hope I was a take-out. I wasn't. :flag: Traditional brakfast, variety of draft beers :flag: Staff and food and drinks are great. Definitely a place to visit while in London :flag: Mac & cheese is vegetarian and delicious.

Clean enough considering how busy it it :flag: If you want to recharge your phone or laptop, the electrical outlet is located at the first floor, to the right after climbing the stairs. :flag: Always too overcrowded, with no seating available on ground floor, due to overcrowding. Still it is the best and only option for local night workers. :flag: You don't need to buy anything to use the wifi.

Runcorn MacDonalds. Never fail to under perform. At least they are consistant :flag: Dan once ate a Big Mac in three and a bit bites. Good effort :flag: Try the pancakes but go easy on the sickly syrup. :flag: Most definitely my favourite Chinese restaurant in Liverpool. Includes student discount and the quantity for the price is unheard of! Must try the duck.. to die for üòçüòçüòç :flag: Arguably the best Chinese in Liverpool, very tasty food, portion sizes are phenomenal! Service can be improved, but can't go wrong with a cheap and cheerful meal at this place. :flag: Amazing food but massive portions - beware! :flag: Great food, terrible service :flag: Lovely, tasty and great value noodle dishes. :flag: Really good Hong Kong style noodle bar. Curry fishball appetiser is amazing. :flag: Hainannese chicken rice is nice :flag: The portions are huge and the food very good for the price! :flag: Goes without saying the soup noodles are amazing-this place definitely deserves its reputation! Drinks wise though try the Pearl Iced Tea, also known as Bubble Tea :flag: They do new dishes, such as belly pork, which were previously served by Tea gather. You can get some Tea gather dishes here. Available at new branch (opposite to richer sounds) only. :flag: Excellent Hong Kong-style restaurant on the edge of Chinatown. Relaxed setting,fantastic service,great selection of superbly prepared authentic Chinese food,and the portion sizes are absolutely huge :flag: At ¬£7 it's a true bargain by today‚Äôs standards where a simple starter would command the same price for nowhere near the quality,quantity and skill levels involved in preparing the Hainan chicken rice :flag: Big Bowl Rice is a must! It comes in great portion, & you might not even finish it (ask for the sauce from the server). Hainan Chicken Rice is also highly recommended.

Definitely recommend. :flag: The Tom yum noodle soup with duck is excellent!!!!! :flag: Big Bowl Noodle –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –æ–≥—Ä–æ–º–Ω—ã–π; –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —Å–º–µ–ª–æ –±—Ä–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –¥–≤–æ–∏—Ö. –ü–æ–¥–æ–∑—Ä–µ–≤–∞—é, —á—Ç–æ –∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–æ–π–Ω–æ. –ë—é–¥–∂–µ—Ç–Ω–æ. :flag: Big portion, small price :flag: Do not order the big bowl noodle or the tom yum fried rice. Both very tasteless! :flag: I like the sweet and sour pork rice here!! :flag: Braised flank curry or soup always hits the spot!:-) :flag: Hot and sour noodles and salt and pepper squid are the best! :flag: Hainan Chicken Dinner is a must! :flag: Must try the big bowl rice! Super worthy! Small Cili padi super hot! Have a try! :flag: Tasty food and big portion.. :flag: Such a fun place to eat but don't bother if you're in a hurry! :flag: Just carry on - drive by here - head west on A580 for a mile or so. There's a lovely Little Chef here that serves miles better food!!! 10x better than this McDonald junk. :flag: Was here Monday. Thought it'd be a nice treat for my daughter as a one-off after school. Had a Big Mac... Was sick as a dog afterwards!!! Had nothing else, just this :( But, staff nice! :} :flag: Avoid it at night. Full of kids. :flag: Went past tonight. Tempted to go in and use the toilets but afraid it may get recycled into 99p burgers. Customers looked like they were waiting to die. :flag: Meet Jeremy Kyle show guests and dads having access to the kids on Saturdays. Dante's Inferno has an extra level. :flag: My tip is don't eat yellow snow or Big Macs. The shameless Lib Con Govt consults M on obesity policy.

They're delish :flag: The Big Mac Meal, Large is the cheapest way to get free glasses. (However, you may have to remind them that they're supposed to give you a free glass!!) :flag: For no salad on your food you must repeat yourself 5 times incase they forget! (only on the drive thru) :flag: A really exhilarating ride. You never get bored of the suspense as you climb to the top of the drop. :flag: Don't look down :flag: It's really fast but I did not enjoy it my last time: it was raining a little bit and windy! And also the ride is rough! :flag: The newer coaster skins are for wide arse yankys. Now not as thrilling as it could be to rough and needs alot of tlc. :flag: Glad to say I've finally done this ride, but it does NOT deserve the hype. Great ride, but didn't get the thrill I anticipated. :flag: The best seats are the last two on the back carriage - you'll get whipped over the top after the lift hill 213ft up this way! :flag: Smile u will be on camera :) :flag: Ride on the back and you'll get dragged down the massive drop :flag: Long queue and rain, but im not arsed :) :flag: Book online 12hrs before visiting. Much cheaper! :flag: Woo !!! I rode the Big One !!! :flag: It's all the opposite of smooth!!! Be carefull with your back :S :flag: Sit at the back. You will get a much more hair-raising ride as you get pulled down the dips :flag: In theory, ride technology should have developed dramatically since this ride was built. Clearly not enough! This old thing impressed me!! :flag: Great bar food. :flag: Great burgers at this Oxford landmark. Also have a great seasonal beer selection. :flag: Great burgers and they are large. Great selection of beers. :flag: This place erupts when you put Four Non Blondes on the juke box. :flag: Best hamburger ever. Onion rings are amazing! :flag: If you're getting lunch, it's best to come after 1 on the weekdays when they aren't getting slammed. :flag: Pasta salad is the best pasta salad you've ever had :flag: Ask Vinnie about #Hercules. 5x homemade lemon pepper jumbo wings, double burger w/bacon and tots.

You can get a pitcher of whiskey and coke here for 15 bucks. :flag: Wings or the Guacamole burger :flag: Mmmmmm paninis :flag: Get the Buffalo Burger but replace the blu-cheese with pepper jack cheese!  AMAZING! :flag: The Turkey Gobbler is awesome, but try taking it to the next level with some Tobacco sauce. Absolutely delicious! :flag: Their jumbo wings are not very jumbo :flag: Decent wings and salads. But best for drink specials and shots! Double well discounts try a whisky sour. Also do pitchers of whisky and coke. :flag: Jason Carter is the best! # graphicdesigngod :flag: Fried mac & cheese bites. :flag: This place has been around forever and is very easy to miss tucked away in an alley. It is quintessential Oxford and we recommend trying the world famous Turkey Gobbler sub! :flag: Natty Tubby (32 oz.) for $3.25 is one of the best deals in town :flag: Fish tacos.. don't do it :flag: Order a lunch box!
